\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{BrickRed}F}{ew} medi\ae{}val documents have exercised a greater fascination over men's minds in these latter days than ``The Chronicle of Jocelin of Brakelond.'' More than sixty years ago the publication of the Latin text of this history, by the Camden Society, attracted the attention of the great Thomas Carlyle, and furnished him with material for sketching his picture of ``The Ancient Monk,'' which occupied the entire second book of his \emph{Past and Present}. Although the modern sage in his own rugged way affected no little contempt for what he called this ``extremely foreign book,'' and for ``the monk-Latin'' in which it was written, it is evident that Jocelin's simple story of the wise, firm, yet withal gentle rule of a medi\ae{}val abbot over a great English monastery cast a spell over him, the influence of which can be detected in every page of his delightful and almost surprisingly sympathetic account of Abbot Samson and of Edmundsbury.

In this case the \emph{Past}, as Carlyle read it in the ``Chronicle,'' was so entirely different from the \emph{Present}, as he knew it in his day, that the wonder is not that he was fascinated by it, but that he was able with its help to paint so true and living a picture and to fashion so fitting a frame in which to set it. For to him, without doubt, the story dealt with what he regarded as ``vanished existences''---``ideas, life-furniture, whole workings and ways,'' which were not only \emph{Past}, but gone beyond recall, and ``covered deeper than Pompeii with the lava-ashes and inarticulate wreck of seven hundred years!''

And indeed it cannot be denied that the ideals and aspirations, as revealed to us in the history of Abbot Samson and, so far as we know, in the life story of his biographer Jocelin, are of a higher and almost a different order to those of our modern world. To men of their calling in those far-off times, the natural and the supernatural were united and intermingled in the simplest and most ordinary way. Their very notions of the unseen world are almost sufficient to take away the breath of those whose lots have been cast in this more material and prosaic age of doubts and disbeliefs. To Samson, and Jocelin, and their fellow-monks at Edmundsbury in the twelfth century, heaven, as a great writer has said of earlier English monasticism, was hardly even ``next door.'' The future life was merely the present continued, and each man went forth to his task as it came and laboured at it day by day, not with any idea of finishing it, but only of carrying on for the span of his allotted existence. They built, and planted, and wrote till the end came, and then they went to heaven and others stepped into their places and took up the common work. It was indeed a ``simple life:'' it was almost Arcadian in its picturesque simplicity, and, as Cardinal Newman says of the same life in the days of our Venerable Bede, it reminds us of those times in the dayspring of the world, when Adam delved and Abel watched the flocks, and Noah tended his vines, and angels visited them.

This living belief in the nearness and all-importance of the supernatural is the key-note of Jocelin's charming story of a few brief years in the long history of an old English abbey, a new translation of which is here given to the public. As a story, however, Brakelond's ``Chronicle'' is not wholly, nor indeed mostly, either mysterious or incredible: there are troubles, and trials, and difficulties enough recounted by the writer; and at every turn we may see evidences of human nature and even of human struggles and passions, which are sufficient, and as some may perhaps think, more than sufficient, to show us that it is a history of men, and not of angels, which the old monk is setting forth so naturally and so truthfully. At any rate, there is quite sufficient of the human element in the narrative to give most of us a human interest in the story.

And this itself is proof that Jocelin is a true chronicler of what really took place, and no mere romancer tempted to edit or suppress entirely what might not be unto ``edification.'' He manifests no desire to make himself or his brethren appear other than what they were in reality---that is, thorough Englishmen, with strong wills and human passions, which, though these same passions might occasionally appear to gain the mastery, they were at all times endeavouring to subdue unto God's service by the help of His grace and through the broad-minded provisions of St.\ Benedict's Rule. The actors who appear in this living drama, though they are for the most part monks, are obviously men, natural and human enough in all their works and words; but these men are at the same time also monks, endeavouring to raise their minds and hearts to supernatural ideals, and striving to attain to that personal communion with God which is the aim and object of all true religion and of all religious observance and practice. This is ``another world truly,'' writes Carlyle, ``and this present poor distressed world might get some profit by looking wisely into it, instead of foolishly. But at lowest, O dilettante friend, let us know always that it \emph{was} a world, and not a void infinite of grey haze with phantasms swimming in it. These old St.\ Edmundsbury walls, I say, were not peopled with phantasms, but with men of flesh and blood, made altogether as we are. Had thou and I then been, who knows but we ourselves had taken refuge from an evil Time and fled to dwell here, and meditate on an Eternity, in such fashion as we could? Alas, how like an old osseous fragment, a broken blackened shinbone of the old dead Ages, this black ruin looks out, not yet covered by the soil; still indicating what a once gigantic Life lies buried there! It is dead now, and dumb; but was alive once and spake. For twenty generations, here was the earthly arena where painful living men worked out their life-wrestle,---looked at by Earth, by Heaven and Hell. Bells tolled to prayers; and men of many humours, various thoughts, chanted Vespers and Matins;---and round the little islet of their life rolled for ever (as round ours still rolls, though we are blind and deaf) the illimitable Ocean, tinting all things with \emph{its} eternal hues and reflexes, making strange prophetic music! How silent now!''

\textbf{The Author.}---Jocelin de Brakelond, the writer of the Chronicle called by his name, was a monk of Edmundsbury. The date of his birth is uncertain, but as he became a novice in that abbey in \oldstylenums{1173}, we may suppose that he was born not later than \oldstylenums{1156}. It has been conjectured that he was a native of Bury St.\ Edmunds, and that his name Brakelond was derived from that of an ancient street of the city, in accordance with the common practice of calling monks by the name of the place from which they came to religion. Little more is known about him than he tells us incidentally in the course of his narrative, but one of his contemporaries in the monastery speaks of him as ``a man of excellent religious observance, as well as a power both in word and work''---\emph{eximiae religionis, potens sermone et opere}. Carlyle sees him in his writing as a man of a ``patient, peaceable, loving, clear-smiling nature.'' A ``wise simplicity,'' he adds, ``is in him; much natural sense; a veracity that goes deeper than words.'' What more can we desire in a writer, especially when we may add that he shows himself to have been a cultured man, acquainted with the ancient authors, quoting Virgil and Horace and Ovid? His knowledge of the Bible is naturally extensive, and, as was common in those days, his very phraseology is obviously founded upon the sacred text. He once likewise cites, with acknowledgment, a short passage from the more modern Ralph de Diceto's \emph{Imagines Historiarum}. Our latter-day philosopher praises him also because he shows himself to have ``a pleasant wit; and to love a timely joke, though in a mild subdued manner; very amiable to see.''

In \textsc{a.d}.\ \oldstylenums{1173}, as just noted, Jocelin entered the community and passed under the care of Samson of Tottington, who subsequently became abbot, but who was then Master of novices. The then abbot, Hugh, was old, and although a high standard of the religious exercises and of the monastic life inside the cloister was maintained, the temporalities were in a sad state, and year by year tended to get from bad to worse, so that Jocelin's early experiences of monastic life were connected with anxieties about the load of debt to money-lenders under which Edmundsbury groaned.

He tells us that he had himself seen bonds for repayment made out to the Jews, under which, for failure to meet the sums falling due, the original loan had grown in eight years from £\oldstylenums{100} to £\oldstylenums{800}. No wonder that the youthful religious questioned his Master of novices as to why some remedy was not found by those in authority for a state of things which meant temporal ruin and disgrace for the community of Edmundsbury.

In \oldstylenums{1180} Abbot Hugh met with an accident and died. After a period of a year and three months the former Master of novices, Samson, then the provident Sacrist, was chosen in his place. It was during this period of vacancy that, in recording something which happened in the monastery, Jocelin incidentally makes mention of another literary work of his own, namely, the \emph{Book of the Miracles of St.\ Robert}, a boy supposed to have been martyred by the Jews in \oldstylenums{1181}, who was entombed in the church at Edmundsbury.

On the election of Samson, Jocelin was appointed his chaplain, and this brought him into the closest connection with the abbot for six years. In \oldstylenums{1198} and \oldstylenums{1200} he was Guest-master, and in \oldstylenums{1212} he held the office of Almoner. In all these offices the future chronicler had exceptional means of acquiring information, and these he utilised in writing the story of Abbot Samson's administration, which is introduced by a vivid sketch of the temporal disorder of the house in the closing years of Abbot Hugh. His Chronicle covers the period of the history of Edmundsbury from \oldstylenums{1173} to \oldstylenums{1190}, and, as he says in the beginning, ``he took care to write only what he himself saw and heard.'' The date of his death is uncertain.

\textbf{The ``Chronicle.''}---The Latin text of \emph{Cronica Joceline} is found complete only in one manuscript---Harl.\ MS.\ \oldstylenums{1005}---in the British Museum. It was printed for the first time by the Camden Society in \oldstylenums{1840} under the editorship of I.\ G.\ Gage Rokewood, who supplied a valuable Introduction and notes, of which subsequent editors have availed themselves. The text was likewise printed in Mr.\ Thomas Arnold's \emph{Memorials of St. Edmund's Abbey} (Rolls Series) I., pp. \oldstylenums{209}--\oldstylenums{336}.

In \oldstylenums{1844}, under the title \emph{Monastic and Social Life in the Twelfth Century, as exemplified in the Chronicle of Jocelin of Brakelond, A.D. \oldstylenums{1173}--\oldstylenums{1202}}, the work was translated by Thomas Edlyne Tomlins. Carlyle's work, \emph{Past and Present}, published in \oldstylenums{1843} had already drawn attention to the ``Chronicle of Jocelin,'' and another edition of Mr. Tomlins' work was called for in \oldstylenums{1849}. This translation has since appeared at least once, but for the present edition a new English version has been carefully prepared from the original Latin text of the Chronicle.

\textbf{Abbot Samson.}---The central figure and, as we may say, ``the hero'' of Jocelin's story is, of course, Abbot Samson. He was born in \oldstylenums{1135} at Tottington, near Thetford, in Norfolk. His father appears to have died when Samson was young, and a pretty legend of a boyish dream in which St.\ Edmund extended his protection to the child against the assaults of the devil, and the recognition of the place seen in the dream as the gate of the monastery of St.\ Edmundsbury, when his mother had taken him with her on a pilgrimage to the shrine of the saint, led to his taking refuge in the cloister. He had received his early instruction from a schoolmaster named William of Diss, and he attained the degree of Master of Arts in the University of Paris. In this place we are not concerned with the events of his life: these may be read for the most part in the Chronicle of Jocelin of Brakelond. What alone seems to be called for in this brief Introduction is some account of his person and character as it is manifested in the scattered evidences of his acts.

If we want a picture of the man let us take Carlyle's, who sketches ``the substantial figure of a man with eminent nose, bushy brows, and clear-flashing eyes, his russet beard growing daily greyer,'' and his hair which, before his elevation to the abbot's chair, had been black, becoming daily more and more silvered with his many cares. We know something of the task that was before him when he gathered up the reins of office, and we may be sure he knew more. But as we see him in the pages of Jocelin, he was not the man to flinch from his duty, or to seek to let difficulties mend themselves by pretending that he did not see them. From the time that he walked barefooted into his church to be installed in the abbatial chair, he let all see that he was abbot and had come to rule. He had set his whole strength to accomplish a great task and his shoulders to sustain an almost overwhelming burden, when in the hour of his election he walked to the altar singing the \emph{Miserere mei} with his brethren. ``His head was held erect,'' says the faithful Jocelin, ``and his face showed no change,'' a portent which called from the king the remark: ``This abbot-elect seems to think himself capable of governing an abbey.''

``It is beautiful''---writes Carlyle in a philosophical appreciation of the principles of monastic government---``it is beautiful how the chrysalis governing-soul, shaking off its dusty slough and prison, starts forth winged, a true royal soul! Our new abbot has a right honest, unconscious feeling, without insolence as without fear or flutter, of what he is and what others are. A courage to quell the proudest, an honest pity to encourage the humblest. Withal there is a noble reticence in this Lord Abbot: much vain unreason he hears; lays up without response. He is not there to expect reason and nobleness of others, he is there to give them of his own reason and nobleness. Is he not their servant, who can suffer from them and for them; bear the burden their poor spindle-limbs totter and stagger under; and in virtue of \emph{being} their servant, govern them, lead them out of weakness to strength, out of defeat into victory?''

Abbot Samson ruled over his house for thirty years, and when in \oldstylenums{1212}, ten years after the end of Jocelin's Chronicle, he died, he was followed to the grave by a sorrowing community whose unstinted reverence and affection he had won. An unknown monk of Edmundsbury, the author of another Chronicle of the house, thus wrote of him: ``On the \oldstylenums{30}th December, at St.\ Edmund's, died Samson, of pious memory, the venerable abbot of that place; after he had prosperously ruled the abbey committed to him for thirty years and had freed it from a load of debt, had enriched it with privileges, liberties, possessions and spacious buildings and had restored the worship of the church both internally and externally, in the most ample manner. Then bidding his last farewell to his sons, by whom the blessed man deserved to be blest for evermore, whilst they were all standing by and gazing with awe at a death which was a cause for admiration, not for regret, in the fourth year of the interdict he rested in peace."

The first business to which Abbot Samson applied himself after his election was the task of understanding and grappling with the deplorable financial state of his house. He insisted upon the immediate production of every claim against the monastery, and by personally visiting each of its many manors he gained a correct knowledge of its resources. Within twelve months he had formed his plans and had quieted every creditor: within twelve years the entire debt had been paid off, and he could turn his attention to building and adorning the house of St.\ Edmund. It is impossible to read the pages of Jocelin without seeing that the ruling idea of the abbot's life was his devotion to his great patron, St.\ Edmund. He was the servant, after God, of the saint, his representative and the upholder of his honour and privileges, the champion of his rights, the guardian of his property. Inspired by this thought he worked to make Edmundsbury worthy of its patron, and in his success he saw the result of the saint's intercession and protection.

``Apart from this special devotion to St.\ Edmund, it is easy to see,'' writes Mr.\ Thomas Arnold, ``that Samson was an earnestly religious man, and not a Christian by halves. After the news had come of the capture of Jerusalem by the Saracens, Samson took the loss of the Holy Places so much to heart, that from that time he wore undergarments of hair-cloth and abstained from the use of meat.''

He was, too, a thorough Englishman, and read admirably---\emph{elegantissime}---the Bible in English---\emph{scripturam anglice scriptam}---and ``he was wont to preach to the people in English---but in the dialect of Norfolk where he had been born and bred.'' On one occasion he gives as a reason, and as some may think, a somewhat strange reason, for appointing a monk to an office, that ``he did not know French.'' He was no doubt anxious to secure that St.\ Edmundsbury should be truly national, with its roots deep in the soil of his country, to teach it to build up its own traditions, and to let people see that it was a great \emph{English} house.

But Samson's work was not accomplished without grave anxiety, none the less because it was unseen by others. Though he walked upright with a smiling face, and had ever the courage to battle for the rights of his house when there was need, in a way that might make people regard him as a man of iron nerve possessed of a soul that never felt any trouble, nevertheless in the first fourteen years of his administration his black hair was blanched as white as snow, and Jocelin speaks of hearing his beloved master walking about when all were in bed and relieving his pent-up feelings with sighs and groans. Once the chronicler took courage to tell his master that he had thus heard him in his night vigil, and to this the abbot replied: ``'Tis no wonder: you (as my chaplain) share in the streets of my office, in the meat and drink, in the journeys and the like, but you little think what I have to do to provide for my house and family, or of the many and difficult matters of my pastoral office, which are always pressing upon me: these are the things which make my soul anxious and cause me to sigh.''

And so when Abbot Samson came to die, the thin veil which to him and his monks of Edmundsbury alone hid the world to come from their vision was parted, and the supernatural life eternal was revealed to him in the most natural of ways. He passed from labour for God and St.\ Edmundsbury, to rest in God and with his loved patron, carrying with him the full sheaves of his good works. Carlyle has only partially caught the idea when he writes: ``Genuine work alone, what thou workest faithfully, that is eternal.'' ``Yes,'' he concludes, ``a noble Abbot Samson resigns himself to oblivion; feels it no hardship, but a comfort; counts it as a still resting-place, for much sick fret, and fever, and stupidity, which in the night-watches often made his strong heart sigh.''

\noindent The present Chronicle comprehends the annals of the Monastery of St.\ Edmund from the year \oldstylenums{1173} to \oldstylenums{1202}. The early pages give a rapid sketch of the state of the Monastery under Abbot Hugh, intended as an Introduction to the History of the Government of Samson de Totington, his successor, whose acts are the chief object of the Chronicle. Abbot Hugh died in \oldstylenums{1180}, and was succeeded by Samson in \oldstylenums{1182}, after a vacancy of a year and three months.

Jocelin de Brakelond, the writer, a native of St.\ Edmundsbury,\footnote{The Long Braklond, leading from the North Gate to the Market Place, and the Little Braklond, are ancient streets of St.\ Edmundsbury mentioned in deeds \oldstylenums{33} Edw.\ I. Regist.\ Croftis, MS.\ Harl.\ XXVII.\ fol.\ \oldstylenums{5}.\ \oldstylenums{10}v.\ \oldstylenums{14}.\ \oldstylenums{15}.} dates his Chronicle from the year when the Flemings were taken prisoners without the town (alluding to the battle of Fornham in \oldstylenums{1173}), in which year, he tells us,\footnote{Vide Chron.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{1}.} that he took the habit at St.\ Edmund's, having made his noviciate under Samson, then Master of the Novices, afterward Abbot, to whose charge he had been specially committed.\footnote{Ibid.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{3}.} According to Bale,\footnote{Script.\ Illust. Bas.\ \oldstylenums{1559}, p.\ \oldstylenums{259}.} he studied at Cambridge; but for this we have not seen any authority. At the time of the election of Abbot Samson, Jocelin was the Prior's chaplain; and within four months was promoted to be chaplain to the Abbot,\footnote{Chron.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{19}.} with whom he lived, to use his own language, day and night for six years.\footnote{Ibid.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{27}. Bishop Tanner, in error, represents that our author was cellarist of the monastery in the 9th Richard I.\ confounding him with Jocellus or Jocellinus, twice cellarist, and afterward appointed to the Altar. Vide Chron.\ pp.\ \oldstylenums{84, 86, 91}; Chronica de Electione Hugonis Abbatis MS.\ Harl.\ \oldstylenums{1005}.\ fol.\ \oldstylenums{164}.} In \oldstylenums{1198} and \oldstylenums{1200}, he did the honours of the abbey as guest-master,\footnote{Chron.\ pp.\ \oldstylenums{71, 95}.} perhaps still continuing one of the Abbot's chaplains; and was afterward almoner, an office which he filled at the death of Samson in \oldstylenums{1211}.\footnote{Ibid.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{50}. Chron. de Electione Hugonis Abbatis, fol.\ \oldstylenums{165}.}

A contemporary monk of St.\ Edmund's has recorded\footnote{Chron.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{50}.} the character of our Chronicler in these simple words: ``Dominus Jocelinus elemosinarius noster, vir religionis eximie, potens in sermone et opere.''

Jocelin de Brakelond wrote\footnote{Ibid.\ \oldstylenums{12}.} on the miracles of St.\ Robert, the boy martyred by the Jews at St.\ Edmundsbury in \oldstylenums{1181}. Bale, and later bibliographers, also ascribe to him the Chronica de Electione Hugonis Abbatis, postea episcopi Eliensis; but the part which our author took, on the occasion of that election, is spoken of in the same Chronicle in such a manner as to leave no doubt that it was the work of another.

The public events recorded in this volume are chiefly those in which the Abbot of St.\ Edmund's had a share during the reigns of Henry II.\ and Richard I. They are not without historical interest; but the merit of the Chronicle lies more in the variety of ordinary incidents detailed, from which often something is to be learnt touching our language, manners, and customs, or our system, civil and religious, particularly the monastic polity.

The style of the work is easy, mixed, but not offensively, with the language of writers sacred and profane, according to the custom of the monastic historians of the age. The story is told throughout with a pleasing naïveté, and sometimes humour; the characters are drawn with spirit, and the whole seems written with truth.

That part of this Chronicle is subsequent to the Chronicle of Diceto, is apparent from the fact, that our author,
commenting on an occurrence in the Monastery of St.\ Edmund during the year \oldstylenums{1200},\footnote{Chron.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{97}.} cites words which he finds apt to his purpose, used by the Dean of London in his Chronicle.

Incorporated in our Chronicle is an episode,\footnote{Chron.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{50}.} headed, ``De Henrico de Essexia,'' being an account of the duel between Henry de Essex and Robert de Montford. The heading is our author's; but the narrative is expressed to be added by a monk who accompanied the Abbot of St.\ Edmund's to Reading, and received the relation from Henry de Essex himself, then in the cloister of the Abbey of Reading. This episode has certain pretensions to classical Latin, and forms a contrast to the easy colloquial style of Jocelin.

At the end of the Chronicle, which breaks off abruptly some years before the death of Abbot Samson, will also be found an evidence of the lands held of St.\ Edmund's granted to the family of Cokefeld. This brief document purports to be written\footnote{Ibid.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{102}.} by William de Dice (Diss), then one of Abbot Samson's chaplains, who had access to the Cokefeld charters, and is in the nature of an appendix to our Chronicle, being obviously added in proof of the right of the monastery to certain lands claimed by Thomas de Burgh as belonging to Nesta de Cokefeld, afterward his wife, the subject of a suit determined against the convent which is spoken of in our Chronicle.

Spelman, Reyner, Battely and others, referring to our author, cite from a MS.\ in the Cotton Collection, Vitellius D.\ \textsc{xv}., which is described in Smith's Catalogue, in these words: ``Chronica Jocelini de Brakelonde de rebus domesticis C\oe{}nobii S.\ Edmundi de Burgo: h.\ e.\ de Abbatibus, prioribus et c\oe{}teris officialibus, de electionibus, de litibus et rebus qualitercumque ad istud C\oe{}nobium spectantibus.'' The MS.\ cited is wanting; and it is conjectured to have suffered in the fire that destroyed part of the Cotton collection.

The present Chronicle is edited from the Liber Albus Monasterii S.\ Edmundi, MS.\ \oldstylenums{1005}, in the Harleian Collection, which MS.\ belonged to the family of Bacon of Redgrave, and afterward to Dr.\ Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester; whence Bishop Tanner\footnote{Bib.\ Brit.} refers to it under the title ``Registrum de Bury, MS.\ Stillingfleet.''

The description which the learned Wanley gives of this Chronicle, in his Catalogue of the Harleian MSS.\ is hardly exact; and his opinion that William de Dice, before-mentioned, was the continuator of the Chronicle from the commencement of the Episode on Henry de Essex, is contradicted by the text. Our author, relating\footnote{Chron.\ p.\ \oldstylenums{83}.} the translation of the body of St.\ Edmund in \oldstylenums{1198}, names William de Dice as one of the twelve monks, including the two Chaplains of the Abbot, selected to be present; the writer at the same time telling us the part he himself took on the occasion. Beside, a comparison of the text will shew, that the hand which sketched the character of Samson the Abbot and other officers of the Monastery, in the early part of the narrative, is the same that pourtrayed Herebert, the prior, in the last pages.

The MS.\ of which we annex a fac-simile, is of the end of the \oldstylenums{13}th, or the beginning of the \oldstylenums{14}th century, and at first sight would seem to be executed by more than one scribe; but perhaps it is the same handwriting throughout, which grows gradually larger in the progress of the copy.

In publishing this Chronicle for the first time, we have thought it best to adhere to the orthography of the MS., at the same time freeing the text from the contractions. Occasionally, at the foot of our pages, we have noted errors of the scribe, or attempted to supply defects; adding often the references to the scriptural or classical allusions of the text. All the dates in the margin are our own; and, where necessary, we have given the proof in our Notes to the volume. We have also added a Glossary.

The seal of Abbot Samson, which forms the subject of our \emph{Frontispiece}, is from an instrument in the Archives of Christ Church, Canterbury, dated \oldstylenums{6} November, \oldstylenums{1200}, being an award in a matter of dispute between the Archbishop of Canterbury and Canons of Lambeth, referred by Pope Innocent III.\ to Hugh Bishop of Lincoln, (for whom Roger, Dean of Lincoln, was substituted) Eustace Bishop of Ely, and the Abbot of St.\ Edmund's.\footnote{Hoveden, \oldstylenums{458}. Diceto, col.\ \oldstylenums{708}.}

The \emph{Tail-piece}, representing the Standard of St.\ Edmund, is from Lydgate, the monk of Bury's, Life and Miracles of the Saint in the Harleian Collection.

\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{BrickRed}I}{ have} undertaken to write of those things which I have seen and heard, and which have occurred in the church of Saint Edmund, from the year in which the Flemings were taken\footnote{The allusion is to the battle of Fornham, November, \oldstylenums{1173}. In this year the quarrel between Henry II. and his sons, culminated in a general rising both in Normandy and in England. Of the leaders of the rebellion in England, Robert de Bellemont, earl of Leicester, was the chief. Having gathered a force of mercenaries in the Low Countries, he landed at Walton, which he failed to take. After joining hands with Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk, at Framingham, and capturing Haughley, he attempted to force his way to his own estates. Meanwhile, the justiciar Richard de Lucy and Humphrey Bohun hastened south from their campaign against the Scots, and having been reinforced by the local levies, they succeeded in intercepting Leicester at Fornham St.\ Geneveve, on the river Lark, four miles south from Bury St.\ Edmund's. The rebels were easily defeated, and Leicester taken prisoner; of his mercenaries only a few escaped. An account of the battle, not very accurate, from the point of view of the St.\ Edmund's monks, is to be found in Appendix E of the first volume of the \emph{Memorials of St.\ Edmund's Abbey}, (Rolls Series). The escape of those mercenaries who did escape is attributed to the intervention of St.\ Edmund and St.\ Thomas.} without the town, in which year also I assumed the religious habit, and in which Prior Hugh was deposed and Robert made Prior in his room. And I have related the evil as a warning, and the good for an example.

Tunc temporis senuit Hugo abbas, et aliquantulum caligaverunt oculi ejus; homo pius et benignus, monachus religiosus et bonus, sed nec bonus nec providus in s\ae{}cularibus exercitiis: qui nimis confidebat suis et nimis eis credebat, de alieno potius quam de proprio pendens consilio.

In those days Abbot Hugh\footnote{Hugh, prior of Westminster, was elected abbot in \oldstylenums{1157}, in succession to abbot Ording. According to Gervase (I., 163), he received his benediction from Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, to whom he made profession of canonical obedience. According to the \emph{Chronica Buriensis} (\emph{Mem}.\ III., \oldstylenums{6}) he was confirmed by the bishop of Winchester. In any case, abbot Hugh, as it related in the text of the \emph{Chronicle of Jocelin} (p.\ \oldstylenums{6}), was freed from all obedience by pope Alexander III.} grew old, and his eyes were dim.\footnote{Gen.\ xxvii., \oldstylenums{1}.} He was a good and kindly man, a godfearing and pious monk, but in temporal matters he was unskilful and improvident. He relied too much on his own intimates and believed too readily in them, rather trusting to a stranger's advice than using his own judgment. It is true that discipline and the service of God, and all that pertained to the rule, flourished greatly within the cloister, but without the walls all-things were mismanaged. For every man, seeing that he served a simple and ageing lord, did not that which was right, but that which was pleasing in his own eyes. The townships and all the hundreds of the abbot were given to firm; the woods were destroyed, and the houses on the manors were on the verge of ruin; from day to day all things grew worse. The abbot's sole resource and means of relief was in borrowing money, that so it might at least be possible to maintain the dignity of his house. For eight years before his death, there was never an Easter or Michaelmas which did not see at least one or two hundred pounds added to the debt. The bonds\linebreak{}

This disease spread from the head to the members, from the ruler to his subjects. So it came to pass that if any official had a seal of his own, he also bound himself in debt as he listed, both to Jews and Christians. Silken caps, and golden vessels, and the other ornaments of the church, were often placed in pledge\footnote{This was illegal. Rokewode (\emph{Chron.\ Joc}., pp.\ \oldstylenums{106}--\oldstylenums{7}) gives instances of fines inflicted on Jews for taking church property in pawn, from the Pipe Rolls of Norfolk and Suffolk.} without the assent of the monastery. I have seen a bond made to William Fitzlsabel for a thousand and two score pounds, but know not the why nor wherefore. And I have seen another bond to Isaac, son of Rabbi Joce, for four hundred pounds, but know not wherefore it was made. I have seen also a third bond to Benedict, the Jew of Norwich, for eight hundred and fourscore pounds, and this was the origin and cause of that debt.

Our buttery was destroyed, and the sacristan William\engnotenum{} received it to restore whether he would or no. He secretly borrowed forty marks at interest from Benedict the Jew, and made him a bond, scaled with a certain seal which was wont to hang at the shrine of St.\ Edmund. With this the gilds and brotherhoods used to be sealed; afterwards, but in no great haste, it was destroyed by order of the monastery. Now when that debt increased to one hundred pounds, the Jew came, bearing letters of the lord king\engnotenum{} concerning the sacristan's debt, and then at last that which had been hidden from the abbot and the monks appeared. So the abbot in anger would have deposed the sacristan, alleging a privilege of the lord pope that enabled him to remove William his sacristan when he would. However, there came one to the abbot, who pleaded for the sacristan, and so won over the abbot that he suffered a bond to be made to Benedict the Jew for four hundred pounds, payable at the end of four years, that is, a bond for the hundred pounds to which the interest had increased, and for another hundred pounds which the same Jew had lent to the sacristan for the use of the abbot. And in full chapter the sacristan obtained that all this debt should be paid, and a bond was made and sealed with the seal of the monastery. For the abbot pretended that the debt was no concern of his, and did not affix his seal. However, at the end of the four years there was nothing wherewith the debt might be discharged, and a new bond was made for eight hundred and fourscore pounds, which was to be repaid at stated times, every year fourscore pounds.

Then came the almoner of the lord king and told the lord abbot that many rumours concerning these great debts had come to the king. And when counsel had been taken with the prior and a few others, the almoner was brought into the chapter. Then, when we were seated and were silent, the abbot said: ``Behold the almoner of the king, our lord and friend and yours, who, moved by love of God and Saint Edmund, has shown to us that the lord king has heard some evil report of us and you, and that the affairs of the church are ill-­managed within and without the walls. And therefore I will, and command you upon your vow of obedience, that you say and make known openly how our affairs stand.'' So the prior arose, and speaking as it were one for all, said that the church was in good order, and that the rule was well and strictly kept within, and matters outside the walls carefully and discreetly managed; and that though we, like others round us, were slightly involved in debt, there was no debt which might give us cause for anxiety. When he heard this, the almoner said that he rejoiced greatly to hear this witness of the monastery, by which he meant these words of the prior. And the prior, and Master Geoffrey of Coutances, answered in these same words on another occasion, when they spoke in defence of the abbot at the time when Archbishop Richard, by virtue of his legatine power, came into our chapter, in the days before we possessed that exemption which we now enjoy.

Now I was then in my novitiate, and on a convenient occasion talked of these things to my master, who was teaching me the Rule, and in whose care I was placed; he was Master Samson, who was afterwards abbot. ``What is this,'' I said, ``that I hear? And why do you keep silence when you see and hear such things­­ you, who are a cloistered monk, and desire not offices, and fear God rather than man?'' But he answered and said, ``My son, the newly burnt child feareth the fire, and so is it with me and with many another.

There came a rumour to Abbot Hugh that Richard, Archbishop of Canter-bury,\engnotenum{} purposed to come and to hold a visitation of our church by virtue of his legatine authority. And having taken advice, the abbot sent to Rome and obtained exemption from the power of the said legate. But when the messenger returned to us from Rome, there was not found means of paying that which he had promised to the lord pope and to the cardinals, unless in the circumstances use might be made of the cross which was above the high altar, and of a Mary, and a John, which images Archbishop Stigand had adorned with much weight of gold and silver, and had given to the blessed Edmund. Then some among our number, who were very intimate with the abbot, said that the very shrine of Saint Edmund itself ought to be stripped in order to win so notable a privilege. But they considered not the great danger that might ensue from so great liberty. For if by chance we should have an abbot who wished to waste the goods of the church and evilly entreat his monastery, then there would be no one to whom the monastery might make complaint of the evil deeds of the abbot, who would fear neither bishop, nor archbishop, nor legate, and whose impunity would give him boldness in wrongdoing.

In diebus illis celerarius, sicut ceteri officiales, appruntavit denarios a Jurneto Judeo, inconsulto conventu, super cartam supradicto sigillo signatam. Cum autem excrevit\footnote[\textdagger]{Excrevisset.} debitum usque ad sexaginta libras, summonitus est conventus ad solvendum debitum celerarii. Depositus est celerarius; licet allegaret gravamen suum, dicens quod susceperat tribus annis hospites omnes in domo hospitum ad pr\ae{}ceptum abbatis sive abbas fuerit pr\ae{}sens sive absens, quos debeat suscipere abbas secundum consuetudinem abbati\ae{}.

Now in those days the cellarer, like the rest of the officers of the monastery, borrowed money from Jurnet the Jew, without the knowledge of the monastery, on a bond sealed with the seal mentioned above. But when the debt had grown to three score pounds, the monastery was called upon to discharge the debt of the cellarer. He was deposed, though he defended himself by saying that for three years he, by command of the abbot, had received all guests in the guest­house, whether the abbot were at home or no, whom the abbot ought to have received according to the constitution of the house.

In his stead Master Dennis was appointed, and by his economy and care reduced that debt of sixty pounds to thirty. Towards the extinction of that debt we paid the thirty marks which Benedict de Blakeham gave to the monastery for the manors of Newton and Whepstead. But the Jew's bond remains with the Jew to this day, and in it twenty-six pounds are written down as principal and for the debt of the cellarer.

On the third day after Master Dennis was made cellarer, three knights with their squires were brought into the guest­house to be entertained there, the abbot being at home and sitting in his chamber. Now when that great­hearted Achilles heard this, not wishing to fail in his office as did the others, he arose and took the keys of the cellar, and bearing the knights with him to the hall of the abbot, came himself into the abbot's presence. And he said to him, ``Lord, you know well that the custom of the abbey is that knights and laymen be received in your hall, if the abbot be at home. I neither wish, nor am I able, to receive guests whose entertainment is your care. But if it be otherwise, take the keys of your cellar, and appoint another cellarer at your pleasure.'' When the abbot heard this, he received those knights perforce and ever after he received knights and laymen in accordance with ancient custom. And they are still so received when the abbot is at home.

In the twenty-­third year of his being abbot,\engnotenum{} it came into the mind of Abbot Hugh to journey to the shrine of the blessed Thomas to pray there. And when he was almost at his journey's end, and was near unto Rochester on the morrow of the Nativity of the Blessed Mary, he most unhappily fell, so that his knee-­pan was put out and lodged in the ham of his leg. Physicians hastened to him, and put him to pain in many ways, but they healed him not. So he was borne back to us in a horse-­litter, and received with great concern, as was fitting. To put it shortly, his leg mortified and the sickness spread to his heart. Pain brought on a tertian fever, and in the fourth fit he died, rendering his soul to God on the morrow of Saint Brice's day.

Ere he was dead, all things were thrown into disorder by his servants, so that in the abbot's houses there was nothing at all left, except stools and tables which could not be carried away. There hardly remained to the abbot a coverlet and quilts which were old and torn, and which someone who had taken away those which were sound, had left in their place. There was not even some thing of a penny's value which might be given to the poor for the good of his soul. The sacristan said that it was not his affair to do this, declaring that he had found the money for the expenses of the abbot and his household for a full month, since neither would those who farmed the townships pay anything before the appointed time, nor would the creditors give any grace, as they saw the abbot to be sick unto death. However the tenant of Palegrave found fifty shillings for distribution to the poor, because he entered upon his tenancy of Palegrave on that day. But those fifty shillings were afterwards again paid to the king's officers, who exacted the full rent for the use of the king.

When Abbot Hugh had been laid to rest, it was decreed in the chapter that one should tell the death of the abbot to Ranulf de Glanvill,\engnotenum{} Justiciar of England. Master Samson and Master Robert Ruffus hastened across the sea, bearing this same news to the lord King, and obtained from him letters directing that the possessions and revenues of the monastery, which were distinct from those of the abbot, should remain entirely in the hands of the prior and of the monastery, and that the rest of the abbey's property should be in the hands of the King. The wardship of the abbey\engnotenum{} was given to Robert de Cokefield and to Robert de Flamvill the seneschal, who at once placed under surety and pledges those of the servants and relatives of the abbot to whom the abbot had given anything after he fell ill, or who had taken anything from the property of the abbot. And they also treated the chaplain of the abbot in the same way, for whom the prior became surety. And entering our vestry, they made a double inventory of all the ornaments of the church.

There being no abbot, the prior\engnotenum{} took care, above all things, to preserve peace in the monastery and to maintain the repute of the house in the matter of receiving guests. He wished to disturb no one, to provoke no one to anger, that he might keep all men and all things in quiet. But he overlooked some acts of our officials which should have been corrected; and especially in the case of the sacristan, as if he cared not how that office was performed. Now the sacristan, while the abbey was vacant, neither paid any debt nor erected any building, but the offerings and accidental receipts were foolishly wasted. Wherefore the prior, who was head of the monastery, seemed to many to be blameworthy, and was called slack. And our brothers reminded each other of this when the time came for electing an abbot.

Samson the subsacristan, who was master over the workmen, did his utmost that nothing which was broken, and no chink or crack, should remain unrepaired. In this way he won the favour of the monastery, and more especially of the cloistered monks. At that time, and under Samson's direction, was our choir built. He determined the subjects, the paintings, and composed elegiac verses for them. He made a great store of stone and sand for building the great tower of the church.\engnotenum{} And when he was asked where he found the money for this work, he answered that some of the townsfolk had given him money secretly for the building and completing of the tower. But some of our brothers said that Warin our monk and custodian of the shrine, had agreed to take, or as it were to steal, some part of the offerings of the shrine, and to spend it for the necessary purposes of the church, especially for the building of the tower. They were led to this opinion by the fact that they saw the strange uses to which these offerings were put by others, who, to speak the truth, did steal them. And in order to remove from themselves the suspicion of so happy a theft, Samson and Warin made a hollow chest, in the middle of the cover of which there was a hole, and which was secured with an iron bar. This chest they caused to be placed in the great church near the door outside the choir, where all the people passed by, that men might place therein gifts for the building of the tower.

Therefore, having taken counsel together how they might attack Samson, his enemies and adversaries went to Robert de Cokefield and to his colleague, who had the wardship of the abbey, and persuaded them to forbid in the name of the king that any one should do any work or build anything while the abbacy was vacant, but rather should the money from he offerings be collected and saved for the payment of some part of the debt. Thus was Samson mocked, and his strength went from him,\engnotenum{} and he could not from that time do any work as he desired. But though his enemies could delay his work, they could not finally interrupt it. For he regained his strength and overthrew the two middle pillars,\engnotenum{} that is, he removed the two wardens in whom the malice of the others trusted. And afterwards in course of time, the Lord gave him power to perform his vow that he would build the said tower, and to finish it according to his wish.

Respondit alter: ``Non honor esset sed onus de homine qui nimis delicatus est in cibo et potu; qui virtutem reputat multum dormire; qui multum scit expendere et parum adquirere; qui stertit quando ceteri vigilant; qui semper vult esse in abundantia, nec curat de debitis qu\ae{} crescunt de die in diem, nec de expensis unde adquietari possint; solicitudinem et laborem odio habens, nihil curans, dummodo unus dies vadat et alter veniat; homo adulatores et mendaces diligens et fovens; homo alius in verbo in alius in opere.

Again, one said of another, ``That brother is a kindly man, friendly and amiable, peaceful and calm, generous and liberal, a learned and eloquent man, and proper enough in face and gait. He is beloved of many within and without the walls, and such an one might become abbot to the great honour of the church, if God wills.'' Another answered, ``It is no credit, but rather a disgrace, in a man to be too particular as to what he eats and drinks, to think it a virtue to sleep much, to know well how to spend and to know little how to gain, to snore while others keep vigil, to wish ever to have abundance, and not to trouble when debts daily increase, or when money spent brings no return; to be one who hates anxiety and toil, caring nothing while one day passes and another dawns; to be one who loves and cherishes flatterers and liars; to be one man in word and another in deed.

And again, one said of his friend, ``That man is almost wiser than all of us, and that both in secular and in ecclesiastical matters.

Another answered, ``That would be true if he were a man of good and approved repute. But his character has been questioned, perhaps falsely, perhaps rightly. And though the man is wise, humble in the chapter, devoted to the singing of psalms, strict in his conduct in the cloister while he is a cloistered monk, this is only from force of habit. For if he have authority in any office, he is too scornful, holding monks of no account, and being on familiar terms with secular men, and if he be angry, he will scarce say a word willingly to any brother, even in answer to a question.''

And when I heard these things, I was wont to answer to those who so judged, and to say that if we had to wait to choose an abbot until we found one without spot or flaw, we should never find such an one, since there is none living without fault, and nothing altogether good. At one time I could not refrain my spirit, but put forward my own opinion only too readily, thinking that I was speaking to faithful ears. And I said that one was not worthy of the abbacy who had before loved me dearly and done much good to me. And I put forward another as worthy and named him, a man whom I loved but little. I spoke according to my conscience, thinking rather of the general well­being of the church than of my own promotion; and I spoke the truth, as subsequent events proved. And behold, one of the sons of Belial revealed my saying to my benefactor and friend, wherefore to this very day I have never been able, by prayer or present, to regain his full favour.

On the morrow after receiving the letters, we gathered in the chapter for the purpose of performing so important a task.

Another brother also, Edmund by name, was sitting by, and declared that Samson would be abbot, relating a dream which he had seen on the previous night. For he said that he had seen in dreams Roger the cellarer and Hugh the third prior standing before the altar, and Samson in their midst, head and shoulders taller than they, and wearing a long and flowing cloak, fastened at his shoulders, and he was standing as it were like a champion about to engage in a duel. Then the holy Edmund arose from his shrine ­as it seemed to the brother in his dream ­and showed his feet and legs bare, as though sickness was upon him. Then when one rose and would have covered the feet of the saint, the saint said, ``Come not near. Lo! he shall cover my feet,'' and pointed his finger towards Samson. This is the interpretation of the dream: In that a champion was seen, this signified that he who was to become abbot would be constant in labour, alike when disputing with the archbishop of Canterbury about the pleas of the crown, and when striving with the knights of St.\ Edmund for the full payment of scutages, or with the burghers about encroachments on the market, or with the sokemen for the suits of hundreds; and that he was as it were a champion anxious to overcome his enemies by fighting, that so far as in him lay he might recover the rights and liberties of his church. Moreover, he covered the feet of the holy martyr, when he completed fully the towers of the church, which had been begun a hundred years before.

Such dreams did our brothers dream, and at once told them first of all in the cloister and then in the court. And so it came to pass that before vespers the people openly said that this and this and this man was elected, and that one of them would be abbot.

And afterwards he ordered his household,\engnotenum{} and transferred various officials to other offices, saying that he proposed to maintain twenty-six horses in his court, and many times he declared that ``a child must first crawl, and afterwards he may stand upright and walk.'' And he laid this especial command upon his servants, that they should take care that he might not be laid open to the charge of not providing enough food and drink, but that they should assiduously provide for the maintenance of the hospitality of the house.

In these matters, and in all the things which he did and determined, he trusted fully in the help of God and his own good sense, holding it to be shameful to rely upon the counsel of another, and thinking he was sufficient unto himself. The monks marvelled and the knights were angered; they blamed his pride, and often defamed him at the court of the king, saying that he would not act in accordance with the advice of his freemen. He himself put away from his privy council all the great men of the abbey, both lay and literate, men without whose advice and assistance it seemed impossible that the abbey could be ruled. For this reason Ranulf de Glanvill, justiciar of England, was at first offended with him, and was less well-disposed towards him than was expedient, until he knew well from definite proofs that the abbot acted providently and prudently, both in domestic and in external affairs.

A general summons was sent out, and on the fourth day of Easter all the barons, and knights, and freemen came to do homage. And, lo! Thomas de Hastings came also with a great multitude of knights, and brought with him Henry his nephew,\engnotenum{} who was not yet a knight, and for whom he demanded the office of steward with the customary dues thereof, as his charter provided. And to this demand the abbot at once answered, ``I neither deny, nor wish to deny, his right to Henry. If he were able to serve me in his own person, I would grant him the means of supporting ten men and eight horses in my court. And if you will present a steward to me, who knows how to fulfil the office of steward and is able to do so, I will receive him on the same terms as my predecessor had his steward on the day whereon he was alive and dead, that is, I will allow him four horses with the things needful for them. But if you will not agree to this, I will make complaint before the king and before the chief justiciar.''

When the abbot had so spoken, the matter was postponed.

For the time, therefore, I would rather accept him than another, even more incompetent, to my loss. By God's help, I will be my own steward.''

When homage had been received, the abbot demanded an aid from the knights, and they promised twenty shillings from each fee of a knight.

And the result was that in a little while he was regarded as a discreet judge, by reason of the books which he had read and the causes which he had tried, and as one who proceeded in the cases which he tried according to the form of law. And for this cause one said, ``Cursed be the court of this abbot, where neither gold nor silver profit me to confound my enemy!''

In course of time, he became somewhat skilled in temporal matters, being guided by his commonsense, for his mind was so subtle that all men wondered, and Osbert FitzHerbert, the under-sheriff, used to say, ``This abbot is given to disputation; if he goes on as he has begun, he will blind us all, however many we be.'' But the abbot, being approved in these matters, was made a justice in eyre, though he kept himself from error and wandering. But ``envy seeks out the highest.'' His men complained to him in the court of St.\ Edmund since he would not give judgment hastily or believe every spirit,\engnotenum{} but proceeded in a judicial manner, knowing that the merits of the cases of suitors are made clear by discussion. It was said that he would not do justice to any complainant, unless money were given or promised; and because his aspect was acute and penetrating, and his face, like Cato's, rarely smiling, it was said that his mind lent rather to severity than to mercy. Moreover, when he took fines for any crime, it was said that judgment rejoiced against mercy,\engnotenum{} for in the opinion of many, when it came to a matter of taking money, he rarely remitted that which he might lawfully take.

But hereupon many of his adversaries raised objections. For they said that he received what he would from the sacristry, and spared his own money, and allowed his corn to lie in the barns until such time as the price should be high. They said that he managed his manors in a way different from that of his predecessors; that he burdened his cellarer with guests who should rather have been received by the abbot, so that the abbot might win repute as a wise man and one who was clever and provident at the end of the year, but the monastery and its officials be thought ignorant and wasteful.

To the others who objected that the abbot went often to his manors, I was wont to answer and to excuse him by saying that the abbot was happier and in better spirits anywhere than at home. This also was the truth, whether on account of the constant complaints which came to him, or on account of those who told him rumours concerning himself.

Then his mother was amazed at his loud cry and at his words. And when she had heard the dream, she took him to St.\ Edmund's, that he might pray there. So coming to the gate of the cemetery, he said, ``Mother mine! see this place! See, the very door which I beheld in my dreams, when the devil would have taken me.''

Of a truth, I fear this above all earthly things, that my house may do something which may make it lawful for me to raven. But so it is, that when they say or do aught against my will, I call to mind that dream, and though I raven in spirit, groaning and gnashing my teeth in secret, I put force on myself that I may raven neither in word nor in deed.

But if any desire to act otherwise, I will publicly announce the name of the accuser. And I will also that every monk shall have free access to me, that he may talk with me of his needs when he will.'' Now this he said because the chief men of our house in the days of abbot Hugh, wishing nothing to be done in the monastery save through them, decreed that no cloistered monk should speak with the abbot, unless he had first shown to the abbot's chaplain that which he desired to say to the abbot and the reason.

Once a certain one of our brothers, who was skilled in this art, had bent his knees before him, and under pretence of giving him counsel, had poured the oil of flattery into his ears, while I stood at a distance and smiled. Then when the brother had gone, the abbot called me and asked me why I had been smiling, and I answered that the world was full of flatterers.

And the abbot said, ``My son, I have been flattered for a long while, and therefore I cannot attend to flattery. There must be much pretence and much concealment that the peace of the monastery may be preserved. I will hear them speak, but they will not deceive me, if I can prevent it, as they deceived my predecessor, who gave such unconsidered attention to them that for a long while before his death he had nothing wherewith to feed himself or his household, save that which he borrowed from creditors. And on the day of his burial there was nothing which could be distributed among the poor, save fifty shillings which were received from Richard the tenant of Palgrave, because on the same day he entered on the tenancy of Palgrave; and this money the same Richard afterwards paid again to the officials of the king, who exacted the full rent for the royal use.''

Those monks whom the abbot, before he acquired the abbacy, had treated as his most cherished and intimate friends, he seldom raised to official positions on the score of his former intimacy with them, unless they were fit persons. Therefore some of our number, who had favoured his election as abbot, said that he showed them less favour than was their due, who had loved him before he was abbot, and that those rather were cherished by him who had slandered him both openly and secretly, and in the hearing of many had publicly declared him to be a hot-tempered man, one who was unsociable, conceited, and a Norfolk cheat. But, just as after he received the abbacy he made no injudicious exhibition of affection or of a desire to honour his former friends, so also he did not show towards the others any of that rancour or hatred which they deserved, returning good for evil on many occasions, and doing good to those who persecuted him.

He had also a characteristic which I have never seen in any other man, namely, that he had a strong affection for many to whom he never or seldom showed a loving face, which the common saying declares to be usual, when it says, ``Where love is, there the glance follows.'' And there was another noteworthy thing, that he wittingly suffered loss from his servants in temporal matters, and allowed that he suffered it; but, as I believe, the reason for this was that he waited for a fit season when the matter might be conveniently remedied, or that by concealing his knowledge he might avoid greater loss.

For his relations he displayed moderate affection, but yet no less tender than that which others are wont to show, since he had no relatives within the third degree, or pretended that he had not.

A riot having been once set on foot, the only hope of safety for the Jews was in taking refuge in some royal castle. Thus at Norwich, where there was a massacre of Jews about this time (Feb.\ \oldstylenums{6}, Diceto), those of them who were found in private houses perished; those who escaped to the castle were safe. So at Lincoln, the rumour of an intended attack having come to their ears, the Jews of the town sought shelter in the ``munitio regia'' (Newb.\ iv.\ \oldstylenums{9}) and saved their lives. At York, where the hideous tragedy of their fate was on so large a scale as to attract the notice of history, the Jews, having been admitted into the castle, would have escaped with life but for their own suspicious folly, which led them to shut the gates against the governor, when for some cause he had gone outside the walls.

The lord abbot sought letters from the king that the Jews might be expelled from the town of St.\ Edmund's, asserting that whatever is in the town of the blessed Edmund, or within the district subject to the jurisdiction of the monastery, belongs of right to the Saint, and that consequently the Jews ought either to be the men of St.\ Edmund, or else be driven from the town. Leave, therefore, was given to him to eject them, provided that they should have all their chattels, as well as the value of their houses and lands. And when they were sent forth, and under armed force were conducted to various towns, the abbot ordered that  in every church and before every altar those should be solemnly excommunicated who should henceforth receive Jews or entertain them as guests in the town of St.\ Edmund's. This provision was afterwards modified by the justices of the king, to the effect that if Jews should come to the great pleas of the abbot in order to exact debts due to them from their debtors, then for this reason they might be entertained for two days and two nights in the town, and depart in peace on the third day.

Now when this large sum of money had been collected with great difficulty and had been paid, the abbot, sitting in the chapter, said that he ought to share somewhat in so great an acquisition as that of so fair a manor. And the monastery answered, ``That is just. Let it be done according to your will.'' And the abbot said that he might lawfully claim half of it, and showed that he had spent more than four hundred marks with great labour, but that he would be content with one portion of that manor, a place called Icklingham, and this was most readily granted to him by the monastery. Hearing this, the abbot said, ``And I receive that portion of the land for my own purposes, not that I may keep it in my hand or to give it to my relations, but that for the good of my soul and of the souls of all of you, I give it to the new hospital at Babwell,\engnotenum{} for the support of the poor and for the use of the hospital.'' So he spoke, and so it was done, and the act was afterwards confirmed by a charter from the king.\engnotenum{}

The abbot learnt that the church of Woolpit was vacant, for Walter of Coutances\engnotenum{} had been elected to the bishopric of Lincoln. And presently he summoned together the prior and most of the monastery, and taking up his tale, said: ``You know well what great labours I have undergone in the matter of the church of Woolpit, and how to secure it for your exclusive use I journeyed to Rome by your advice, in the days of the schism between Alexander and Octavian.\engnotenum{} And I traversed Italy at the time when all clerks bearing letters of pope Alexander were seized, some of them being imprisoned and others hanged, and others, after having their noses and lips cut off, were sent back to the pope to his shame and confusion. I, however, pretended that I was a Scot,\engnotenum{} and put on Scottish dress, and adopted the manners of a Scot. And I often shook my staff as they shake the weapon which they call a gaveloc at those who mocked me, shouting threatening words in the manner of the Scots. To those who met me and asked me who I was, I answered nothing except, `Ride, ride Rome, turne Cantwereberei.'\engnotenum{} I acted thus that so I might conceal my purpose, and as a Scot might safely reach Rome. Then when I had obtained from the lord pope such letters as I desired, on my homeward way I passed by a certain castle as the road led me from the city. And, lo! the officers of the castle surrounded me, laying hold on me, and crying, `This wanderer, who makes himself out to be a Scot, is either a spy or one bearing letters of the false pope Alexander.' And while they closely examined my clothes and boots and undergarments, and even the old shoes, which I carried on my shoulders in the Scottish manner, I put my hand into the little bag which I carried, and in which the letter of the lord pope was contained, lying under a little cup from which I was wont to drink. And the Lord God and St.\ Edmund willing it, I drew out the writing and the cup together, so that, stretching my hand on high, I held the writ underneath the cup. And they saw the cup, it is true, but they did not notice the writ. And so I escaped their hands, in the name of the Lord. Whatever money I had on me they took away, so that it was necessary for me to beg for my bread, spending nothing, until I came to England. But when I heard that the church was given to Geoffrey Ridel,\engnotenum{} my soul was grieved with the thought that my labour had been vain. So when I reached home I secretly cast myself before the shrine of St.\ Edmund, for I feared that the lord abbot would seize me and cast me into prison, who had deserved no ill. And there was no monk who dared to speak with me, and no layman who dared supply me with food, save secretly. At length, the abbot took counsel and exiled me to Acre,\engnotenum{} and there I long remained. These and many other countless ills I have suffered for the sake of the church of Woolpit. But blessed be God, Who maketh all things work together for good! Behold! the church for which I have borne so many hardships, is given into my hand, and now I have the power to give it to whomsoever I will, since it is vacant. And I restore it to the monastery, and for its sole use I assign the ancient customary due or pension of ten marks, which you have lost for more than sixty years. I would give it in its entirety to you with pleasure were I able to do so; but I know that the bishop of Norwich would forbid this, or if he were to grant it, he would make it an excuse to demand subjection and obedience from you, which is neither wise nor convenient. Therefore let us do what we may lawfully do. Let us place there a clerk as vicar to answer to the bishop for the spiritualities, and to you for the ten marks; and I wish, if you agree, that the vicarage may be given to some relative of Roger de Hengham, a monk and your brother, who was my companion in that journey to Rome, and was exposed to the same dangers as I was and for the same cause.''

In a manor of the monks of Canterbury, which is called Eleigh, and which is in the hundred of the abbot, there chanced to be a murder. But the archbishop's men would not allow the murderers to take their trial in the court of St.\ Edmund.

Then the king answered that he had never given a charter to the prejudice of our church, and that he did not wish to take from the blessed Edmund anything which he had formerly possessed.

And the abbot, still angry, replied, ``I thank you as much as if you had cut off both my feet; by the face of God, I will never eat bread until that building be overturned. You are an old man, and you ought to know that neither the king nor his justiciar may change anything or build anything within the jurisdiction of the monastery, without the leave of the abbot and the house. And who are you, that you are so very presumptuous? Nor is this without harm to my mills, as you pretend, for the burghers go to your mill, and grind their corn at their pleasure, while I cannot lawfully hinder them, since they are free men. And I would not allow even the mill of the cellarer, which has been newly built, to stand, had it not been that it was built before I was abbot. Depart,'' he went on, ``depart. Before you come to your house, you will hear what has come to pass in the matter of your mill.''

Then master Jordan de Ros, who had charters both from abbot Hugh and the said Robert, came forward, and addressing both parties, said that whichever of them proved his claim to the church, he ought to have the position of rector.

Then the abbot was perturbed and angered with him, nor did he ever receive him into his favour until the same Jordan in the chapter of the monks of Thetford, owing to the abbot's insistence, resigned into the hands of the bishop, who was present there, that half absolutely, without any conditions or hope of recovery, in the presence of a number of clerks. When this had been done, the abbot said, ``My lord bishop, I am bound on a promise to give the revenue to one of your clerks, and I will give the half of this church to whichsoever of your clerks you will.''

After this a dispute arose between the abbot and this same Jordan about the land of Herard in Harlow, as to whether or no it was a free fief of the church.

But while I so thought I suddenly called to mind that some other had already said to him this word, and that I had heard the abbot answer that he could not dismember his barony, that is, that he ought not to reduce the liberty and dignity which abbot Hugh and others, his predecessors, had possessed in the matter of giving churches, which brought little or no gain to the monastery.

And so he took counsel, and at last recognised the right as belonging to St.\ Edmund and the abbot.

Therefore when all the knights had been overcome, the abbot might have made great gain of money from so notable a victory, had he not desired to spare some of them. For whenever twenty shillings are charged on a fee, there will remain for the abbot twelve pounds, and if more or less be charged, then more or less will remain according to the due proportion. Further, the abbot and his predecessors were wont at the end of twenty weeks to give seven shillings for the wardship of the castle of Norwich from his own money, to supply the defect of the three knights; fees which earl Roger Bigod holds of St.\ Edmund. And all the knights of the four constabularies used to pay twenty-eight pence when they began to make wards, and one penny to the marshal who collected those pennies, and they gave twenty-eight pence and no more, because the ten knights of the fifth constabulary were wont to assist the other forty. Therefore, when they ought to have given three shillings in full, they gave only nineteen pence, and one who should have entered upon the duty of making ward at the end of four months, entered at the end of twenty weeks. Now, however, all the knights paid three shillings in full, and the amount by which it has been increased beyond twenty-nine pence remains to the abbot, wherefore he can repay himself the said seven shillings.

Thus was seen how the threats of the abbot, which he uttered on his first day when he received the homage of his knights, had their fulfilment, when, as has been related, all the knights promised him twenty shillings and at once went back on their promise, refusing to give him a total sum of more than forty pounds in making aids and performing wards and in all like things.

The said Henry, then, while he enjoyed great prosperity, had the reputation of a great man among the nobles of the realm, and he was renowned by birth, noted for his deeds of arms, the standard-bearer of the king, and feared by all men owing to his might. And when others who lived near him enriched the church of the blessed king and martyr Edmund with goods and rents, he on the contrary not only shut his eyes to this fact, but further violently, and wrongfully, and by injuries took away the annual rent of five shillings, and converted it to his own use.

Then Henry resisted the said Robert in the council, and utterly denied the charge, so that after a little while the matter came to a trial by battle. Then when they met at Reading to fight on an island somewhat near the abbey, there gathered there also a multitude of persons, to see how the affair would end. And it came to pass, that when Robert manfully made his armour ring again with hard and frequent blows, and his bold beginning promised the fruit of victory, Henry's strength began to fail him a little. And as he looked round about, behold! on the edge of land and water, he saw the glorious king and martyr Edmund, armed and as it were flying in the air, and looking towards him with an angry countenance, often shaking his head in a threatening manner, and showing himself full of wrath. And Henry also saw with the saint another knight, Gilbert de Cereville, who appeared not only less than the saint in point of dignity, but also head and shoulders shorter; and he looked on him with accusing and angry glances. This Gilbert, by order of the said Henry, afflicted with bonds and tortures, had died, as the result of an accusation brought against him by the wife of Henry, who cast the penalty for her own ill-doing on an innocent man, and said that she could not endure the evil suggestions of the said Gilbert.

Geoffrey Ridel, bishop of Ely, sought from the abbot a supply of wood for making some great buildings at Glemesford, and the abbot granted this request against his will, for he did not at that time dare to offend the bishop. But while the abbot was staying at Melford, a certain clerk of the bishop came and asked on behalf of his lord that they might be allowed to take the said wood at Elmswell; and he made a mistake in his speech, saying Elmswell where he should have said Elmset, the latter being the name of a certain wood at Melford.

Then when Richard the forester of the same township had heard this, he told the abbot privately that the bishop in the preceding week had sent his carpenters as spies into the wood of Elmset, and that they had chosen the best trees in the whole wood, and marked them with their signs.

But when we made complaint on this matter and sent our messengers to the lord Ranulf Glanvill, who was then justiciar, he answered that he was well aware that forty pounds ought to be rendered from the town\engnotenum{} to our sacristan annually, and especially for the lights of the church. And he added that abbot Hugh, according to his pleasure and in his chamber, without the assent of the monastery, had given the office of bailiff as often and to whomsoever he would, saving the forty pounds of revenue for the altar; it was therefore not remarkable if the officials of the king exacted this right on the king's behalf. Then in rough tones, he called all us monks fools in that we had allowed our abbot to do such things, not thinking that the chief duty of monks is to keep silence, and to shut their eyes to all the faults of their prelates, nor thinking of the fact that we are called cheats if in any matter, either rightly or wrongly, we raise opposition, and that sometimes we are accused of treason, and sometimes condemned to imprisonment and exile.

In course of time, however---I know not for what reason---new bailiffs were again appointed elsewhere than in the chapter, and without the assent of the monastery, on which account there was a fear of the same or greater danger after the death of abbot Samson than there had been after the death of abbot Hugh.

And one of our brothers, who was fully confident of the love and friendship of the abbot, took an opportunity to address the abbot on this matter, with due modesty, and he declared that the monastery murmured for this cause. When the abbot heard this he was long silent, as if he were somewhat troubled for this, and at last, so it is said, answered as follows: ``Am not I, even I, the abbot? Is it not my affair to dispose of the goods of the church committed to my care, provided that I act wisely and according to God? If there be a default in the administration of the king's justice in this town, I shall be accused on the matter, I shall be summoned to the court, on me will fall the labour of the journey and the expense, and the defence of the town and of that which pertains thereto. It will be I who am regarded as a fool, and not the prior or the sacristan or the monastery. No, it will be I, who am and ought to be their head. By my means and by my counsel, with God's help, the town shall be preserved unharmed so far as in me lies, and the forty pounds of annual rent to the altar shall be preserved. Let the brothers murmur; let them blame me; let them say what they will among themselves. I am their father and abbot, and while I live, I will not give mine honour to another.''

The merchants of London wished to be quit from toll at the fair of St.\ Edmund's. Many, however, though unwillingly and under compulsion, paid it, and on this account many tumults and a great disturbance occurred between the citizens of London in their court.

To this the abbot answered that, were it needful, he could easily bring the king to warrant him that he had never made them a charter in prejudice of our church, or to the injury of the liberties of St.\ Edmund, to whom the holy Edward had granted and confirmed toll and theam\engnotenum{} and all regalian rights before the conquest of England. And he added that king Henry had given to the Londoners quittance from toll throughout his own demesnes, where he had the right to give it; for in the city of St.\ Edmund's he could not give it, for it was not his to give.

When the Londoners heard this, they decreed with common assent that none of them should come to the fair of St.\ Edmund's, and for two years they did absent themselves, whence our fair suffered great loss, and the offerings in our sacristry were greatly diminished. Eventually, when the bishop of London and many others had mediated, an agreement was reached between them and us whereby they should come to the fair, and some of them should pay toll, but this should be at once returned to them, that by such a device the privilege of both parties might be maintained.

For they had taken fifteen pence from the carts of the citizens of London, which were coming from Yarmouth and carrying herrings, and which passed through our town. And the citizens of London said that they had been quit of toll in every market, and always and in every place, throughout all England, from the time when the city of Rome was first founded, at which time the city of London was also founded. They said that they ought to have this privilege throughout all England, both on the ground that their city was a privileged city, which had been the metropolis and capital of the kingdom, and on the score of the antiquity of the city.

In the tenth year of the abbacy of abbot Samson, by common counsel of our chapter, we made complaint to the abbot in his court and said that the receipts from all the goods of the towns and boroughs of England were increased, and had grown to the advantage of the possessors and the greater profit of their lords, save in the case of this town, which had been wont to pay forty pounds and had never had its dues increased. And we said that the burghers of the city were responsible for this, since they held so many and such large stands in the market-place, shops and sheds and stalls, without the assent of the monastery, and at the sole gift of the bailiffs of the town, who were annual holders of their offices, and as it were servants of the sacristan, being removable at his good pleasure.

But when the burghers were summoned, they answered that they were under the jurisdiction of the king, and that they ought not to make reply, contrary to the liberty of the town and their charters, concerning that which they had held and their fathers well and in peace, for one year and a day without dispute. And they said that it was the old custom that the bailiffs should, without consulting the monastery, give to them places for shops and sheds in the market-place, in return for some annual payment to the bailiwick. But we disputed this, and wished the abbot to dispossess them of such things as they held without having any warrant for them.

Then the abbot came to our council, as if he had been one of ourselves, and privately informed us that he wished, so far as he could, to do right to us; but that he had to proceed in a judicial manner, and that he could not, without the judgment of the court, dispossess his free men of their lands and revenues, which they had, whether rightly or wrongly, held for many years.

The burghers, therefore, took counsel and offered the monastery a revenue of a hundred shillings for the sake of peace, and that they might hold that which they held as they had been accustomed.

But when the abbot had returned from Germany, the burghers offered him sixty marks, and sought his confirmation of the liberties of the town, under the same form of words as that in which his predecessors Anselm and Ording and Hugh had confirmed them to them. And this also the abbot graciously conceded.\engnotenum{} But while we murmured and grumbled, a charter was made for them, as he had promised to them; and as it would have been a source of shame and confusion to him if he had been unable to do that which he had promised, we would not oppose him, or provoke him to anger. But the burghers, from the time when they had the charter of abbot Samson and of the monastery, were full of confidence that they would never lose their holdings and liberties in the time of abbot Samson; and, therefore, never afterwards would they, as they had done before, give or offer the said revenue of a hundred shillings.

The abbot, however, at length turned his attention to this, and assembling the burghers together about the matter, said that if they would not make their peace with the monastery, he would forbid their sheds to be put up at the fair of St.\ Edmund's. Then they answered that they would give every year a silken cope, or some other ornament to the value of a hundred shillings, as they had before promised.

And one said to his companion, ``Are not our cellarer and sub-cellarer, or cannot they be, as faithful men as the sacristan or as the chamberlain? The result is that this abbot or his successor will associate a clerk with the sacristan, and a clerk with the chamberlain, and a clerk with the subsacristans, to collect the offerings at the shrine, and so with all the officials, whereby we shall become a laughing-stock and a scorn to all people.''

But,'' he continued, ``there is yet one possible danger which may arise after the death of abbot Samson, and such a danger has never been in all the days of our life. There is no doubt that the officers of the king will come and will take the abbey into his hand, that is, the barony which pertains to the abbot, as has been done hitherto, after the death of other abbots, and as was done before on the death of abbot Hugh, the officials of the king will desire to appoint new bailiffs in the town of St.\ Edmund, alleging as their authority that abbot Hugh did this. And for the same reason, in course of time, the officials of the king will appoint a clerk of theirs to watch over the cellar, that all things may be done through him and by his command, and they will say that this ought to be done, because abbot Samson did so. And in this way they will be able to mingle and to confound the affairs and revenues of the abbot and of the monastery, which abbot Robert,\engnotenum{} of happy memory, after taking counsel, separated and divided from each other.''

Hubert Walter, archbishop of Canterbury, and legate of the apostolic see and justiciar of England, after he had visited many churches, and had changed many things and introduced innovations by his legatine authority,\engnotenum{} on his return from his carnal mother, who was dying at Dereham\engnotenum{} where she dwelt, he sent to us two of his clerks, who bore sealed letters from their lord, in which it was announced that we should give credence to their sayings and acts. Then these clerks made enquiry of the abbot and monastery as to whether we would receive their lord, the legate, who was coming to us, in such a manner as a legate ought to be received, and as he had been received in other churches. And if we would grant this, then he would shortly come to us, to settle the business and affairs of our church according to God, with the advice of the abbot and monastery. But if we would not grant this, those two clerks would explain to us more in detail the message of their lord.

Then the abbot summoned the majority of the monastery and we took counsel that we should give a favourable answer to the clerks who had been sent to us, saying that we would receive their lord, as legate, with all honour and respect, and that we should send with them our messengers, who should say the same to the lord legate on our behalf. And our idea was that, as we had previously done in the case of the bishop of Ely and other legates, we should show him all honour with a procession and the ringing of bells, and receive him with the other due ceremonies, until perchance he should come to hold a visitation in the chapter. And if he wished to do this, then at last we should all resist him in common to the face, appealing to Rome and trusting to our charters.

The lord abbot said also, ``If the legate now wishes to come to us, let us act in this manner as has been said. But if he delay his coming to us for a while, let us again seek counsel of the lord pope, and ask what force the privileges of our church, which we have obtained from him and his predecessors, ought to have as against the archbishop, who has obtained power from the apostolic see over all the other privileged churches of England.'' Such then was our counsel.

And when the archbishop heard that we would receive him as legate, he received our messengers graciously, and with giving of thanks. And he became kind and friendly to the lord abbot in all his affairs, and delayed his coming among us for a while on account of some urgent business. Therefore, without any delay the abbot sent to the lord pope the same letters which the legate had sent to the monastery, which announced that he would come to us by the authority of his legation and by the authority of the lord pope, and in which it was written that power had been given him over all the exempt churches of England, notwithstanding letters granted to the church of York and others.

This letter opens thus, ``Cum ecclesia vestra ecclesi\ae{} Roman\ae{} sit filia specialis [note the resemblance of phrase], et ad eam nullo pertineat mediante, vos . . . . ad apostolicam sedem tanquam ad caput vestrum in arduis ducitis recurrendum.''} asserens ecclesiam nostram spiritualem filiam suam nulli legato respondere, nisi legato a latere domini pap\ae{} misso, et prohibuit, ne in nos manum extenderet; et adjecit dominus papa de suo, prohibens etiam, ne in aliquam aliam ecclesiam exemptam potestatem exerceret.

So at the instance of the messenger of the abbot, the lord pope wrote\engnotenum{} to the lord of Canterbury and declared that our church, his spiritual daughter, was accountable to no legate, unless it might be to a legate \emph{a latere}, sent by the lord pope, and forbade him to stretch forth his hand over us. And the lord pope added, on his own account, that he further forbade him to exercise power over any other exempt church. Our messenger returned to us and the matter was hidden for some days. But it was made known to the lord of Canterbury by his friends in the court of the lord pope.

Now when at the end of the year the legate made his visitation in Norfolk and Suffolk, and had come first to Colchester, he sent a secret messenger to the abbot, and informed him that he had heard it said many times that the abbot had obtained letters against his legation, and asked that he would send those letters to him in a friendly way. And so it was done, for the abbot had two copies of the letters in identical terms. But the abbot visited the legate neither in person nor through any intermediary, as long as he was in the bishopric of Norwich, lest he might be thought to desire to come to terms with the legate as to the matter of providing entertainment for him, as the other monks and canonical persons had done. The legate, for his part, was disturbed and angry, and fearing that he would be shut out if he should come to us, passed through Norwich, Acre, and Dereham to Ely, making his way towards London.

Then within a month, the abbot appeared before the legate between Waltham and London, in the king's highway, and the legate blamed him because he would not come to him as justiciar of the lord king, when he was in that district. But the abbot answered that he had been there not as justiciar, but as legate, making scrutiny in all churches, and brought forward as his excuse the season of the year, and that the Passion of the Lord drew near, at which time it was necessary for him to be engaged in divine services and in the observances of the cloister. And when the abbot met words with words and objections with objections, and could not be terrified or bent, the legate answered with anger that he well knew that he was skilled in argument, and that he was a better clerk than the legate was.

Therefore the abbot, without passing over in a cowardly manner things which ought not to be mentioned, or speaking arrogantly of those things which had to be said, in the audience of many men, answered that he was the type of man who would never allow the liberty of his church to be infringed, either owing to lack of knowledge or to lack of money, even if it were necessary for him to die or be condemned to perpetual banishment. And when an end was made of these and other like altercations, the legate began to blush when the abbot spoke softly and prayed that he would deal more mildly with the church of St.\ Edmund, for the sake of his native land, for he was as it were a son of St.\ Edmund and there brought up. He blushed, indeed, because he had thoughtlessly poured forth the poison which he had conceived within him.

On the morrow, word was brought to the archbishop of Canterbury that the lord of York was coming to England as legate,\engnotenum{} and that he had hinted many evil things to the lord pope concerning him, saying that he had oppressed the churches of England by taking on account of his visitation thirty thousand marks of silver. For that reason the legate sent his clerks to the abbot, asking that he would write with the other abbots to the lord pope and defend him. And then the abbot granted this, and gave witness that the lord of Canterbury had neither come to our church, nor oppressed that or any other church, speaking according to his knowledge. And when the abbot had handed over those letters to the messengers of the archbishop, he said before all men that he had no fear even if the archbishop wished to make an improper use of these letters.

All the rest assented to the demand, but Hugh Avalon, bishop of Lincoln, refused to do so.}

King Richard sent orders to all the bishops and abbots of England that every nine knights should furnish a tenth,\engnotenum{} and that these should come to him in Normandy without delay, with horses and arms, to help him against the king of France. It therefore was necessary for the abbot to be responsible for the sending of four knights. And when he had caused all his knights to be summoned, and had gathered them together on this matter, they answered that their fees, which they held of St.\ Edmund, were not liable to this, and that neither they, nor their fathers, had ever gone out of England, though they had sometimes paid scutage by command of the king.

Then the abbot was in a difficult position, as on the one hand he saw that the liberty of his knights was endangered, and on the other feared lest he might lose seisin of his barony for default of service to the king, as had happened to the bishop of London and to many barons of England. And he at once crossed the sea, and having wearied himself with many labours and expenses and with the many presents which he gave to the king, at first he was unable to come to terms with the king by means of a money payment. And so, when the king said that he needed neither gold nor silver, but instantly demanded the four knights, the abbot offered him four mercenary knights. And the king received these and sent them to the castle of Eu.\engnotenum{} And the abbot gave them thirty-six marks at once for their expenses for forty days.

But on the morrow there came certain friends of the king, and counselled the abbot that he should proceed cautiously, saying that the war might last for a full year or more, and the cost of the knights increase and multiply to the perpetual loss of him and his church. They therefore advised that before he left the court, he should come to terms with the king, so that he might be quit of the said knights after forty days. Then the abbot, taking good advice, gave a hundred pounds to the king for this quittance, and so returned to England in high favour with his lord. And he bore with him the king's writ that distraint should be levied on the fees of his knights to repay him for the service which he had made to the king on their behalf.

When the knights were summoned, they alleged their poverty and many different grievances, and offered their lord two marks from each fee.

At that time, though the abbot incurred great expenses over sea, he did not return empty-handed to his church, but brought with him a golden cross and a precious copy of the scriptures, which was worth twenty-four marks.

And he added that as he was abbot he ought to acquire something which was fitting for an abbot, and saying this he offered the monastery a costly chasuble and a mitre inlaid with gold, and sandals with silken buskins, and the head of a pastoral staff, made of silver and well worked.

In the year of grace one thousand one hundred and ninety-seven, certain changes and alterations were made

When our cellarer did not find his ancient revenues sufficient, abbot Samson ordered that fifty pounds should be given him in annual increase from Mildenhall by the hand of the prior. This was not to be paid at one time, but in instalments every month, that in each month there might be something to spend, and that the whole might not be used up in one part of the year; and so it was done for one year.

But the cellarer and his assistants complained of this, and he said that if he had had that money in his hands, he would have provided for himself and gathered stock for himself. Then the abbot, against his will indeed, granted that request. And when the beginning of August came, the cellarer had already spent the whole amount, and moreover owed twenty-six pounds, and was bound to pay a debt of fifty pounds before Michaelmas.

And when the abbot heard this, he was wroth, and spoke thus in the chapter, ``I have often threatened that I would take our cellar into my own hands owing to your incompetence and extravagance, since you bind yourselves with great debt. I placed my clerk with your cellarer as a witness, that the office might be managed with greater care. But there is no clerk or monk who dares tell me the cause of the debt. It is said, indeed, that the too elaborate feasts in the prior's house, which occur with the assent of the prior and of the cellarer, and the superfluous expense in the guest-house owing to the carelessness of the guest master, are the cause of it. You see,'' he went on, ``the great debt which is pressing on us; tell me your opinion as to the way in which the matter should be remedied.''

Many of the cloistered monks, hearing this, and, as it were, laughing to themselves, were pleased with what was said, and said privately that what the abbot said was true.

On the morrow the abbot came and again said to the monastery, ``Give me your advice as to how your cellar may be more thoughtfully and better managed.'' And there was no one who would answer a word, save one who said that there was no waste at all in the refectory whence any debt or burden could arise.

And with these words, he deposed the cellarer and guest-master, and replaced them with two monks, with the titles of sub-cellarer and guest-master, and associated with them a clerk of his table, master G., without whose assent nothing was to be done in the matter of food and drink, or in expenditure or in receipts. The former buyers were removed from the work of buying in the market, and food was to be purchased by a clerk of the abbot, and our deficits were to be made good from the abbot's treasury. Guests who ought to be received were received, and those who ought to be honoured were honoured. Officials and cloistered monks alike took their meals in the refectory, and on all sides superfluous expenses were cut down.

About this time it happened that the anniversary of abbot Robert\engnotenum{} was to be celebrated in the chapter, and it was decreed that a Placebo and a Dirige should be sung more solemnly than was wont, that is, with ringing of the great bells, as on the anniversaries of abbots Ording and Hugh. The cause of this was the noble deed of the said abbot Robert, who separated our goods and revenues from those of the abbot. But this solemnity was due to the counsel of some that so the heart of the lord abbot might be moved to do well. One there was, however, who thought that this was to be done to the shame of the abbot, who was accused of wishing to confound and intermingle his affairs and revenues and ours, in that he had taken our cellar into his own hand.

Then when the abbot heard the unusual ringing of bells, and knew well and considered that this was contrary to custom, he wisely hid the cause of the action and sang mass solemnly. But on the following Michaelmas, since he wished to silence the murmurs of some men in part, he appointed him who had been sub-cellarer to the post of cellarer, and ordered another to be nominated as sub-cellarer, though the same clerk remained with them and procured all needful things as before. But when that clerk passed the bounds of moderation, saying, ``I am Bu,''---whereby he meant that the cellarer had passed the bounds of temperance in drinking,---and when, without consulting the abbot, he held the court of the cellarer and took sureties and pledges, and received the revenues for the year and spent them with his own hand, he was publicly called chief cellarer by the people.

And when the clerk often wandered through the court, and many poor and rich debtors followed him as if he had been master and chief agent, as well as claimants of divers sorts and on divers matters, perchance one of our officials stood in the court. He saw this, and wept for shame and confusion, thinking that this was a shame to our church, and thinking of the danger which would result, and thinking that a clerk was preferred to a monk to the prejudice of the whole monastery. Accordingly he, whoever he was, procured by means of another, that this should be fitly and moderately pointed out to the lord abbot, and it came to pass that it was brought to the abbot's knowledge how arrogant the clerk was, and what he did to the shame and wrong of all; and that he was the cause of great disturbance and discord in the monastery. But when the abbot heard this, he at once ordered word to be sent to the cellarer and to the said clerk, and commanded that the cellarer should henceforth regard himself as cellarer in the receipt of money, and in holding pleas, and in all other matters, saving this only, that the said clerk should assist him, not on an equality, but as a witness and adviser.

Hamo Blund, one of the richest men of that town, being on his death-bed, was scarce willing to make any will.

On the morrow of the Nativity of the Lord, meetings and sports\engnotenum{} and bandying of words were held in the cemetery between the servants of the abbot and the burghers of the town; and from words it came to blows, from blows to wounds, and to bloodshed. But when the abbot knew of this, he privately called together some of those who had come to the spectacle, but who had taken no part in it, and commanded the names of all the offenders to be written down. And he caused all of them to be summoned to appear to make answer before him in the chapel of St.\ Denis on the morrow of the feast of St.\ Thomas the archbishop. And in the meantime he would not invite any of the burghers to his table, as he had been wont to do in the first five days of Christmastide.

Mr.\ Gage Rokewode's correction is evidently right.

So on the appointed day, when oath had been taken from sixteen legal men, and their evidence had been heard, the abbot said, ``It is well known that those wrong-doers have broken the canon \emph{Latae sententiae}. But as there are laymen in both parties, and they know not how great a crime is such notable sacrilege, that the others might fear the more I will excommunicate them by name and publicly, and that justice may not be in any wise lacking, I will begin with my domestics and servants.''

Then this was done, when we had robed and lighted the candles.

And when the assessors of the abbot had come, monks and clerks, they told him in lamentable tones that more than a hundred men lay thus naked, and the abbot was grieved. Yet showing the rigour of the law in his word and face, and concealing the kindness of his heart, he wished to be compelled by his advisers to absolve the penitents, knowing that mercy should be exalted against judgment, and that the church should receive all penitents. Therefore all were heavily scourged and absolved, and all swore that they would abide by the judgment of the church for the sacrilege which had been done.

A commission of the lord pope\engnotenum{} was issued to Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and the lord bishop of Lincoln, and to Samson, abbot of St.\ Edmund's, for the reformation of the church of Coventry and for the restoration of the monks, without hearing the case again. And so the parties to the suit met at Oxford, and the judges received letters from the lord king, asking that the matter might be postponed. Then the archbishop and the bishop dissembled and kept silence, and as it were sought the favour of the clerks. But the abbot alone spoke openly as a monk for the monks of Coventry, publicly favouring their case and defending them. And by his means, it advanced so far on that day that a certain simple seisin was made to one of the monks of Coventry to the value of one pound.

And behold the acceptable time, the day which had been desired! Of this I cannot write without joy, for that I had the care of the guests.

The abbot built a new larder for himself in his court, and gave the old larder of the monastery for the use of the chamberlain, since it was unfittingly situated under the dormitory.

Moreover, when the abbot saw that the silver table of the high altar, and many other precious ornaments, had been alienated for the recovery of Mildenhall and for the ransom of king Richard, he would not restore that table or other similar things, which for a like pur pose might be torn away and distrained. But he turned his attention to the construction of a most valuable crest over the shrine of the glorious martyr Edmund, that his ornament might be placed there, whence for no reason could it be taken away, and where no man would dare to lay hands upon it. Indeed, when king Richard was taken captive in Germany, there was no treasure in England which was not given or for which redemption was not made, yet the shrine of St.\ Edmund remained intact.

For when there was a dispute before the justices in the exchequer court as to whether the shrine of St.\ Edmund should be partially dismantled for the ransom of the king, the abbot arose and said, ``Know it for the truth that this shall never be done by me, nor is there any man who can compel me to assent to this. But I will open the doors of the church; let him enter who will, let him approach who dares.'' And all the justices answered with oaths, ``I will not come near it,'' ``I will not come near it.'' And they said, ``St.\ Edmund is even more angered against those who are far away and absent, than he is with those who are present and would take away his cloak.'' And when this had been said, the shrine was not stripped, nor was a ransom paid for it. And for this cause the abbot omitted other things, and turned his mind with forethought and providence to the making of a crest for the shrine. And now the plates of gold and silver resounded between the hammer and the anvil, and the smiths worked with their tools.

Adam de Cokefield died,\engnotenum{} and left a daughter of three months as his heir, and the abbot gave the wardship of the fief to whomsoever he would. But king Richard, at the request of some ofhis friends, earnestly sought the wardship and the child for the advantage of a servant of his own, both by letters and by messengers. But the abbot replied that he had given the wardship, and had confirmed the gift under his charter; and sending a messenger to the king, tempted him with prayers and presents, that he might so calm his wrath.

Then the king answered with great anger that he would avenge himself on the proud abbot, who opposed him, if he were not ready to refrain from his reverence for St.\ Edmund whom he feared.

I will never bend to do readily that which he desires, and it shall never be done by my means. For there is fear that such an action might be drawn into a precedent to the hurt of my successors, and for this matter I will never give the king money. Let the Most High regard it.

So he sent the dogs for which the king asked to him, and in addition he sent also horses and other valuable gifts. And when the king had graciously received these, he commended the uprightness of the abbot and his fidelity to his trust publicly in the presence of his earls and barons, and sent to the abbot in token of his friendship and love a valuable ring, which the lord pope Innocent the Third had given him for his great affection to him, and which was the first gift which had been made to him after his coronation.

Many marvelled at the changes in the customary dues which took place with the orders or consent of the lord abbot Samson. From the time when the town of St.\ Edmund's received the name and liberty of a borough,\engnotenum{} the men of every house had been wont to give to the cellarer one penny at the beginning of August for the reaping of our corn, which tax was called rep-selver. And before the town was free all were wont to reap as slaves, and only the houses of the knights and chaplains and servants of the court were free from this tax. But as time passed, the cellarer spared some of the richer men of the town and exacted nothing from them.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
alii burgenses, hoc videntes, publice dicebant, quod nemo qui haberet messuagium proprium deberet dare illum denarium, sed illi qui alienas domos conducebant.

When the other burghers saw this, they said publicly that no one who had a messuage of his own ought to pay that penny, but only those who rented the houses of others. Afterwards, all in common sought this freedom, coming to the lord abbot about it, and offering an annual payment in place of this exaction. Then the abbot learnt that the cellarer had gone through the town to collect rep-selver in a wrongful manner, and that he had caused sureties to be taken from the houses of the poor men, taking sometimes tripods, and at others doors, and other goods, and how the old women appeared with their distaffs, threatening and cursing the cellarer and his men. And he decreed that twenty shillings should be given to the cellarer every year at the next portman-moot, by the hand of the bailiff, before August, by the burghers who should give money to pay this.

And this was done, and confirmed by our charter. And they were given quittance from a certain customary due which is called sor-penny, in return for four-shillings to be paid at the same time.

Then the abbot being anxious to define with definite conditions the offices of the cellarer and of the sacristan, and to calm disputes, as though he favoured the side of the sacristan, gave orders that the servants of the bailiff of the town and the servants of the cellarer should enter together the fee of the cellarer to take robbers and malefactors. And he ordered that the bailiff should have half the pay due for the imprisonment and guarding of the men and for the labour required, and that the court of the cellarer should go to the portman-moot, and that there cases which had to be adjudged should be adjudged with common assent. And it was also resolved that the men of the cellarer should go to the toll-house with the rest, and there renew their sureties, and that they should be inscribed in the roll of the bailiff, and pay a penny to the bailiff there, which payment is called borth-selver, and that the cellarer should have half of it.

The old customs of the cellarer, which we have seen, were as follows:---The cellarer had a messuage and barns near Scurun's well. There he was wont to hold his court solemnly for the trial of robbers and all other pleas and disputes. There he used to place his men in pledge and enrol them, and to renew the pledges every year, and to take for this such money as the bailiff took at the portman-moot. This messuage, with the garden adjoining it, which a tenant holds now, was the manor of Beodric,\engnotenum{} who was formerly lord of that town, and the town was therefore formerly called Beodricsworth, and his demesne lands are now in the demesne of the cellarer. That which is now called averland was the land of his villeins. The total amount of his holding and those of his men was thirty times thirty acres of land, and these are still the fields of the town. The service from this, when the town was made free, was divided into two parts, so that the sacristan or bailiff might receive a free tax of twopence from each acre. The cellarer was to have the ploughing and other services, that is, the ploughing of one rood for every acre without giving of food, and this custom is still observed.

Again, the cellarer used to have authority in the roads without the town, so that no one was permitted to dig for chalk or clay without a licence from him. And he used to summon the fullers of the town, that they should give cloth for his chalk. Otherwise, he would prohibit them the use of water, and would take the webs which he found there, and these customs still maintain. And also whoever bought of the cellarer corn or anything, used to be free from toll at the gate when he went out, for which cause the cellarer sold his goods at a higher price, and this custom still remains. Also the cellarer was wont to take toll from flax, when it was carried about, at the rate of one bundle from each load. And the cellarer alone ought, and used, to have a free bull in the fields of this town; now more men have free bulls. And whenever any one gave his land held in burgage in frank almoin to the monastery, and this was handed over to the cellarer or to another official, that land was wont to be quit from haggovele, and especially when it was assigned to the cellarer, on account of the importance of his office, for that he is the second father in the monastery, and for respect to the monastery, since the state of those who procure our food ought to be good. This custom the abbot regards as unjust, since the sacristan loses his service.

The cellarer was also wont to warrant the servants of the court, that they should be free from scot and tallage, but now this is not the case, for the burghers say that the servants of the court ought to be quit indeed as far as they are servants, but not in so far as they hold land in burgage in the town, and in so far as they or their wives buy or sell publicly in the market. The cellarer was wont to take all the manure in every street for his use, except such as was before the doors of those who had averland; for they alone might collect and have it. That custom rather fell into abeyance in the time of abbot Hugh, until Dennis and Roger de Hengham were cellarers. They, wishing to revive the ancient custom, seized the manure carts of the burghers, and caused them to be unloaded. But as a number of burghers then resisted successfully, every one now collects the manure which is on his holding, and the poor sell theirs when and to whom they will.

The cellarer had also this right in the market of the town, that he and his agents should buy first in the case of all food for the use of the monastery, if the abbot were not at home. The buyers of the abbot or of the cellarer, whichever should come first to the market, was to buy first, either the former without the latter, or the latter without the former; in case they both came at the same time, the preference was given to the abbot's agents. At the time when herrings were sold, the abbot's agents were always to buy a hundred herrings for a penny less than other men, and the cellarer and his agents had the same right. If a load of fish or other food should come first to the court or should come into the market, and the load had not been taken from the horse or from the cart, then the cellarer and his agents might buy and take for themselves the whole load without toll. Abbot Samson, however, ordered his agents that they should give place to the cellarer and his agents, because, as he himself said, he would rather that he lost than his monastery. Accordingly, the agents, in honour preferring one another,\engnotenum{} when anything came to be sold which was not enough for both parties, bought the thing jointly and divided it equally, and so discord became concord between the head and the members, and between the father and his sons.

The poet has said that envy aims at the highest, and so I relate that when a certain person saw the present writing, and read of so many good actions, he called me a flatterer of the abbot, and said that I was hunting after grace and favour, telling me that I had passed over in silence some things which ought not to have been left unmentioned. And when I asked him what things, and what sort of things these were, he answered, ``Have you not seen that the abbot gives the escheated lands in the demesnes of the monastery, and heiresses of lands being minors, and widows both within and without the town of St.\ Edmund's, to whomsoever he will? Have you not seen that the abbot has attracted to himself suits and pleas of those who by the royal writ claim lands which are of the fee of the monastery, and more especially suits in which there is money to be gained; and that he passes on those suits in which there is no profit to the cellarer or the sacristan or the other officials?''

And to this I answered as best I knew how, and perhaps well, perhaps ill, saying that every lord of a fief, to whom homage is due, ought to have the escheat by law, when there is one in the fief, whence he receives homage; and for a similar reason, ought to have a general aid from the burghers and the wardship of boys, and marriage rights over widows and girls, in those fees whence he has homage; and all these things seemed to belong to the abbot alone, unless by chance the abbacy should be vacant. In the town of St.\ Edmund's, however, as it is a borough, there is a custom that the wardship of a boy, until he comes to years of discretion, and his inheritance, vests with the nearest relative.

In the year of grace one thousand one hundred and ninety-eight, the glorious martyr Edmund willed to terrify our monastery, and to teach us that his body should be more reverently and carefully guarded. There was a certain wooden floor between the shrine and the high altar, on which were two candles, which the guardians of the shrine used to relight. And they were wont to put one candle on another, and to stick them together carelessly. And under this floor many things were lying together in an untidy manner, such as flax and thread and wax and vessels of different sorts, in fact the keepers of the shrine used to put there whatever came into their hands, behind the door with iron sides which the place had.

On the night of St.\ Etheldreda's day then the keepers were asleep, and part of a candle, which had been relit, fell, as we believe, while it was still burning, on the same floor which was covered with rags. And it caught all things which were near it, and those above and underneath went on fire, so that the iron walls were all white hot. And lo! the anger of the Lord was kindled, but not without mercy, as it is written, In wrath remember mercy.\engnotenum{} For in the same hour the clock struck before the hour of matins, and the master of the vestry arose and perceived and knew of the fire. Then he ran at once, and sounding the gong, as if for a dead man, he cried with a loud voice and said that the shrine was on fire.

Then we all ran up and found the fire raging with incredible fierceness, and surrounding the whole shrine, and almost reaching the beams of the church. Then the young men ran for water, some to the well and some to the clock, and some used their hoods, and with great labour put out the fire. But first they stripped some of the altars. Then, when cold water had been poured on the front of the shrine, the stones fell and were reduced as it were to dust. And the nails with which the silver plates were fastened to the shrine came out of the wood, which had been burnt to the depth of my finger, and the plates hung one from another without nails.

Now it happened by the will of the Most High, that at this time the great beam, which had been over the altar, had been taken away that it might be newly carved. It happened also that the cross, and the little Mary, and the John, and the chest with the garment of St.\ Edmund, and the case containing the relics, which had formerly hung from the same beam, and other holy things which had stood on the beam, had all been carried away beforehand. Otherwise, we believe that they would all have been burnt, as a painted cloth was burnt, which was hanging in the place of the beam. But what would have happened if the church had been hung with curtains?

So when we were sure that the fire had nowhere entered the shrine, after carefully looking at the cracks and chinks, wherever they were, and after seeing that all was cold, our sorrow was greatly lessened. And lo! some of our brothers cried with much wailing that the cup of St.\ Edmund was consumed. And when many sought the stones and metal plates in all directions among the ashes and cinders, they brought forth the cup quite unharmed. It was lying in the midst of a heap of ashes, which were now cool, and it was found covered with a linen cloth, which, however, was half-burned. The oak chest, also, in which the cup was usually placed, had been burnt to ashes, and only the iron fastenings and the iron lock were found. Then when we saw this miracle, we all wept for joy.

Then when we saw that the greater part of the front of the shrine had been ruined, and were angered at the wickedness of the cause of the fire, with common assent a goldsmith was privately summoned, and we caused him to make plates and fix on the shrine without any delay, that the scandal might be avoided, and we caused the signs of the fire to be covered up with wax or in some other way.

And so when it was impossible to conceal it altogether, we answered those who asked that a candle had fallen and burnt three napkins, and that owing to the heat of the fire some stones on the front of the shrine had been destroyed.

Now all this was done, by the providence of the Lord, that the places round the shrine of His saint might be more honestly cared for, and that that which the lord abbot proposed might the more quickly come and without delay come to a fitting conclusion.

At this time some great person, I know not who it was, came and told a vision of his to the abbot, whereby the abbot was much moved, and related it in full chapter with a very bitter speech. And he told it in this way: ``That is a true vision,'' he said, ``which a certain great man has seen.

And we perish with hunger and thirst, when we cannot have our food save by means of a clerk of the abbot and through his ministration.

Then as he sat in the chapter, he ordered a cellarer and subcellarer to be chosen by our common assent; and he removed his clerk, saying that whatever he had done, he had done for our welfare, calling to witness God and His saints, and excusing himself in many ways.

Hear, O Heaven,\engnotenum{} the things which I speak; give  ear, O earth, to the deed of abbot Samson. For, when the feast of St.\ Edmund drew nigh,  the marble stones were polished, and all things were made ready for the elevation of the shrine. Accordingly, the feast was celebrated on a Friday, and on the following Sunday a three days' fast was proclaimed to the people, and the cause for that fast was publicly announced. Moreover, the abbot preached to the people that they should prepare themselves for the transference of the shrine and for placing it upon the high altar, until the masons should have completed their preparations. And he appointed a time and method for so great a work.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Cum ergo venissemus illa nocte ad horas matutinas, stetit magnum feretrum super altare, vacuum intus, ornatum coriis albis cervinis, sursum et deorsum et circumcirca, qu\ae{} affigebantur ligno clavis argenteis, et panellus unus stetit deorsum juxta columnam ecclesi\ae{}, et sanctum corpus adhuc jacebat, ubi jacere solebat.\engnotetext{That is, where it had lain since its translation by abbot Baldwin in \oldstylenums{1095}, for an account of which see Hermannus (\emph{Mem}., I., \oldstylenums{84--9}). The various translations of the relics of the saint are noticed in the table of dates to be found at the end of these notes.} Percantatis laudibus, omnes accessimus ad disciplinas suscipiendas. Quo facto, vestiti sunt in albis dominus abbas et quidam cum eo, et accedentes reverenter, sicut decebat, festinabant detegere loculum.

Therefore, when we had on that night come to the time of matins, the great shrine stood upon the altar empty within, adorned with white doe-skins, and one panel stood below against a pillar of the church, and the holy body lay still where it was wont to lie.\engnotenum{} Then hymns of praise were sung, and we all went to take our discipline. After that, the lord abbot and some with him were clothed in white raiment, and approaching with reverence, as was right, hastened to uncover the coffin.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Erat autem pannus lineus exterius, qui loculum et omnia c\ae{}tera includebat, qui quibusdam ligamentis suis desuper ligatus inventus fuit; postea quidam pannus sericus, et postea alter lineus pannus, et postea tertius, et ita tandem discoopertus est loculus stans super ligneum alveolum, ne ipse loculus possit l\ae{}di a lapide marmoreo.

Now there was a linen cloth outside, which covered the coffin and all the other things, and which was found to be fastened with some strings of its own. Next there was a silken cloth, and then another linen cloth, and then a third, and so at last the coffin was uncovered and stood upon a wooden stand, that the coffin might not be harmed by the marble stone.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Jacuit super pectus martyris, affixus loculo exterius, angelus aureus ad longitudinem pedis humani, habens ensem aureum in una manu, et vexillum in altera; et subtus erat foramen in operculo, ubi antiqui custodes martyris solebant manus imponere ad tangendum sanctum corpus. Et erat versus superscriptus imagini:
\begin{verse}
Martyris ecce zoma servat Michaelis agalma.
\end{verse}
Erantque annuli ferrei ad duo capita loculi, sicut solebat fieri in cista Norensi.\footnote[\textdagger]{Ducange gives ``Norrensis'' as an occasional equivalent for ``Northmannus.'' Does ``cista Norensis'' then mean ``a Norwegian chest''?}
\end{otherlanguage}

\switchcolumn

Above the breast of the martyr, and on the outside of the coffin, there lay a golden angel of the length of a man's foot, having a golden sword in one hand and a standard in the other. And beneath it was a hole in the coffin's cover, where the former guardians of the martyr were wont to put in their hands to touch the holy body. And there was this verse written over the image:
\begin{verse}
Lo! the image of St.\ Michael keeps the martyr's corpse.
\end{verse}
And there were iron rings at the two ends of the coffin, as there used to be in Danish chests.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Sublevantes ergo lo culum cum corpore, portabant usque ad altare, et apposui manum meam peccatricem in auxilium ad portandum, licet abbas pr\ae{}cepisset, ne aliquis accederet, nisi vocatus; et inclusus est loculus in feretro, panello apposito et conjuncto.
\end{otherlanguage}

\switchcolumn

Therefore raising the coffin with the body, they bore it to the altar, and I gave my sinful hand to help in the carrying, though the abbot had ordered that no one should approach unless he were summoned. And the coffin was enclosed in the shrine, the panel being put in place and shut up.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Putabamus omnes, quod abbas vellet loculum ostendere populo in octavis festi et reportare sanctum corpus coram omnibus; sed male seducti sumus, sicut sequentia docebunt. Feria quarta, canente conventu completorium, locutus est abbas cum sacrista et Waltero medico, et initum est consilium, ut duodecim fratres vocarentur, qui fortes essent ad portandos panellos feretri, et prudentes essent ad conjungendos eos et disjungendos. Dixitque abbas se habere in votis videre patronum suum, et se velle sibi associari sacristam et Walterum medicum ad inspection em; et nominati sunt duo capellani abbatis, et duo custodes feretri, et duo magistri de vestiario; et alii sex, sacrista Hugo, Walterus medicus, Augustinus, Willelmus de Dice, Robertus, Ricardus.
\end{otherlanguage}

\switchcolumn

Now we all thought that the abbot would show the coffin to the people in the octave of the feast, and would have the holy body translated in the presence of all men; but we were quite deceived, as that which followed proved. On the Wednesday, while the monastery was chanting compline, the abbot spoke with the sacristan and Walter the physician, and having taken counsel, summoned twelve brothers, who were strong to bear the panels of the shrine, and were skilled in fastening and unfastening them. And the abbot said that he had prayed to see his patron saint, and that he wished that the sacristan and Walter the physician should be joined with him in making the inspection. And the two chaplains of the abbot were named, and the two guardians of the shrine, and the two masters of the vestry, and six others, the sacristan Hugh, Walter the physician, Augustine, William de Diss, Robert and Richard.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Dormiente ergo conventu, vestiti sunt illi duodecim albis, et extrahentes loculum de feretro portaverunt illum, et ponentes super tabulam juxta antiquum locum feretri, paraverunt se ad disjungendum operculum, quod conjunctum et confixum erat loculo sexdecim clavis ferreis longissimis. Quod cum difficultate fecissent, jussi sunt omnes longius abire, pr\ae{}ter duos socios pr\ae{}nominatos.
\end{otherlanguage}

\switchcolumn

So while the monastery slept, those twelve dressed in white, drew the coffin from the shrine, and bore it and placed it on a table near the old place of the shrine. And they prepared themselves to remove the cover, which was joined and fastened to the coffin with sixteen very long iron nails. And when they had with difficulty done this, all were ordered to stand afar off, save the two associates above mentioned.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Eratque loculus ita repletus sancto corpore, et in longitudine et in latitudine, quod vix posset acus interponi inter caput et lignum, vel inter pedes et lignum: et jacebat caput unitum corpori, aliquantum levatum parvo cervicali.

\switchcolumn

Now the coffin was filled with the holy body, and that both in respect of its length and of its breadth, so that it was hardly possible for a needle to be placed between the head and the wood, or between the feet and the wood. And the head lay joined to the body, being a little raised by a small pillow.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Abbas ergo intuens cominus, invenit post pannum sericum velantem totum corpus, et postea pannum lineum miri candoris; et super caput pannum parvum lineum, et postea alium parvum pannum sericum efc subtilem, tanquam hoc esset velum alicujus sanctimonialis femin\ae{}. Et postea invenerunt corpus involutum lineo panno; et tunc demum patuerunt omnia lineamenta sancti corporis.

And so the abbot looking near, found after this a silken cloth which covered the whole body, and then a linen cloth of wonderful whiteness; and over the head a little linen cloth, and another small and skilfully made silken cloth, as it were the veil of some holy woman. And then they found the body wrapped in a linen cloth, and so at last all the lines of the holy body were clearly traceable.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Hie restitit abbas, dicens se non esse ausum ultra procedere, ut sanctam carnem nudam videret. Accipiens ergo caput inter manus suas, gemendo ait: ``Gloriose martyr, sancte \AE{}dmunde, benedicta sit illa hora qua natus fuisti. Gloriose martyr, ne vertas michi in perditionem audaciam meam, quod te tango, peccator et miser: tu scis devotionem et intentionem meam.'' Et procedens tetigit oculos et nasum valde grossum, et valde eminentem, et postea tetigit pectus et brachia, et sublevans manum sinistram digitos tetigit, et digitos suos posuit inter digitos sanctos. Et procedens invenit pedes rigide erectos tanquam hominis hodie mortui, et digitos pedum tetigit, et tangendo numeravit. 
\end{otherlanguage}

\switchcolumn

Here the abbot stopped, saying that he dared not go further, and behold the naked body of the saint. Therefore, he held his head between his hands, and said with a groan, ``Glorious martyr, holy Edmund, blessed be that hour in the which you were born. Glorious martyr, turn not my daring to my hurt, in that I, who am a sinner and wretched, touch you. You know my devotion and my intention.'' And then he touched the eyes and nose, the latter being thick and very large, and afterwards touched the breast and arms, and raising the left hand touched the fingers and placed his own fingers between those of the saint. And going further, he found the feet standing upright as though they had been the feet of a man but lately dead, and he touched the toes, and counted them as he touched them.

Datumque est consilium, ut c\ae{}teri fratres vocarentur et miracula viderent, et venerunt sex vocati et sex alii fratres cum illis qui se intruserunt sine assensu abbatis, et videbant sanctum corpus; scilicet, Walterus de Sancto Albano, et Hugo infirmarius, et Gilbertus frater prioris, et Ricardus de Hehingham, et Jocellus celerarius, et Turstanus Parvus, qui solus manum apposuit et pedes sancti tetigit et genua.

And then counsel was taken that other brothers should be summoned and behold these miraculous things, and six came upon summons, and six other brothers who forced their way in without the assent of the abbot, and these saw the holy body. Their names were Walter de St.\ Alban's, Hugh the farmer, Gilbert the prior's brother, Richard de Hengham, Jocell the cellarer, and Thurstan the Little; and the last alone put forth his hand and touched the feet and knees of the saint. And, that there might be abundance ofwitnesses, by the disposition of the Highest, one of our brothers, John de Diss, sat on the roof of the church with the servants of the vestry, and saw all these things plainly.

His factis, affigebatur operculum loculo eisdem clavis et totidem, et simili modo, ut prius, cooperto martyre eisdem pannis et eodem ordine, sicut prius inventus fuit.

On the news of the invasion of Sweyn (\oldstylenums{1010}) he removed the relics to London, where they remained for three years. At a subsequent date he became a monk at the monastery of St.\ Edmund. An account of him is to be found in Hermannus (\emph{Mem}., I., \oldstylenums{35--42}), and in Samson's work, \emph{De Miraculis Sancti Aedmundi} (\emph{Mem}., I., \oldstylenums{116--132}).

\switchcolumn

After these things had been done, the cover was fastened on the coffin with the same nails as before, and with the same number and in the same manner, and the martyr was covered with the same cloths and those in the same order, as he had first been found. And then the coffin was placed in its accustomed place, and on the coffin, near the angel, there was placed a certain silken bag, in which a document, written in English, was put setting forth certain salutations of Aylwin the monk,\engnotenum{} as it is said, and this document was before found near the golden angel when the coffin was uncovered.

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Et jubente abbate, statim scriptum fuit et aliud breve, et in eodem furulo reconditum, sub hac forma verborum: ``Anno ab incarnatione Domini \textsc{mº c}.\ nonagesimo octavo, abbas Samson, tractus devotione, corpus sancti \AE{}dmundi vidit et tetigit, nocte proxima post festum sanct\ae{} Katerin\ae{}, his testibus---'' et subscripta sunt nomina decem et octo monachorum.

And by order of the abbot another little writing was also made, and hidden in the same bag, and the words of this second writing were as follows. ``In the year of the incarnation of the Lord one thousand one hundred and ninety eight, abbot Samson, being led by devotion, saw and touched the body of St.\ Edmund, on the night next after the feast of St.\ Catherine, in the presence of these witnesses,''---and there were written below the names of the eighteen monks.

Then the brothers wrapped the whole coffin in a sufficiently large linen cloth, and placed above it a valuable new silken cloth, which Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, had sent as an offering in the same year, and they placed a certain double linen cloth of the same length as the coffin next the stone, that neither the coffin nor the wooden platform on which it rested might be injured by the stone. After this the panels were brought up and fitly joined together in the shrine.

And when the monastery came to chant matins, and saw these things, all who had not seen the body were grieved, and said among themselves, ``We have been grossly deceived.'' But when the hours of matins had been chanted, the abbot called the monastery before the high altar, and having briefly explained to them that which had been done, declared that it was neither right nor possible to summon them all to such events.

Four days later the abbot deposed the guardians of the shrine, and the guardian of the shrine of St.\ Botolph,\engnotenum{} and he appointed new guardians for whom he laid down rules, that they might take more honest and diligent care of the sanctuaries. And the great altar, up to this time, was concave, and on it things were often placed with little reverence. This space and that which was between the shrine and the altar, he caused to be filled up with stone and cement, that there might be no danger of fire possible for the negligence of the guardians, as had been the case before, according to that which a wise man says, Happy is he whom the perils of others make cautious.

At that time some of our officials complained and said in the chapter that Ralph the porter, our servant, appeared in cases and suits against them to the injury of the church and to the prejudice of the monastery.

Therefore orders were given that the cellarer should withdraw from him, not the salary which of right pertained to his office, according to the witness of his charter, but certain additions and grants which the cellarer and subcellarer had made to him, without the assent of the monastery. But the same Ralph, taking with him certain of those of the table of the abbot, complained to the abbot on his return from London, that the prior and the monastery had deprived him of his salary, of which he was possessed when the abbot first came into the abbacy.

Then the abbot believed this, and was moved more than was right or usual with him, and constantly excusing Ralph and protesting that he was innocent, came into the chapter.

But the older and wiser men of the monastery, who wisely kept silence, at last declared that obedience was due to the abbot in all things, unless they were clearly against God, and they agreed in declaring that we must bear with this evil doing for a time and for the sake of peace, lest worst should befal us.

Now the abbot, being absent, frightened some by his threatening messages, and won over some with his graciousness, and he caused the chief men to abandon the views of the whole body, as though they feared his garments. And so the gospel was fulfilled, ``Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation.''\engnotenum{} And the abbot said that he would in nowise come among us, owing to our conspiracies and the oaths which, as he said, we had taken against him, that we would kill him with our knives.

Then he returned home and sat in his chamber.

Next day counsel was taken to summon the abbot and to humble ourselves before him in word and gesture, whereby his mind might be calmed, and so it was done. Then he answered with some humility, but always justifying himself and blaming us, and when he saw that we were ready to be conquered, he was overcome. And with many tears, he swore that he had never been so grieved for anything as for this matter, both for his own sake and for ours, and especially for the evil report, which had already spread abroad our dissension, and which said that the monks of St.\ Edmund wished to slay their abbot.

Then when the abbot had also told how he absented himself of intent until his anger should have cooled, and repeated the word of the philosopher, I would not have taken vengeance on you, unless I had been angry, he arose with tears and received all and every one of us with the kiss of peace.

Geoffrey Ruffus, our monk, though he lived in rather too secular a manner, was of use to us in the custody of four manors, Barton, Pakenham, Rougham, and Bradfield, where there had often in former times been a deficiency in rent. But when the abbot heard ill reports of his morals, for a long while he concealed the matter, perchance because Geoffrey was clearly useful to the whole community. At last, when the truth was known, he suddenly caused his chests to be taken and placed in the vestry, and all the stock of the manors to be strictly guarded, and placed the said Geoffrey in the cloister. There was found a great store of gold and silver to the value of two hundred marks, and all of this the abbot decreed should be devoted to the building of the front of the shrine of St.\ Edmund.

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}
Instante festo sancti Michaelis, decretum est in capitulo, ut duo fratres, non unus solus, succederent ad custodiendum maneria, quorum unus erat R.\ de Hehingham, qui publice promisit se velle et se bene posse custodire simul maneria et cellariam, et assensum pr\ae{}buit abbas, sed conventu invito; et depositus est Jocellus de cellaria, qui bene et provide instauraverat officium suum, et duobus annis rexerat cellariam, sine debito, contra consuetudinem aliorum celerariorum, et factus est subcelerarius.

And when Michaelmas came it was decided in the chapter that two brothers, and not one alone, should succeed to the custody of the manors. Of these one was Roger de Hengham, who publicly promised that he would as well as he could take charge both of the manors and the cellar, and the abbot assented to this, though the monastery was unwilling. Jocell, the cellarer, was then deposed. He had well and providently managed his office, and had controlled the cellar for two years, without contracting debt, contrary to the custom of the other cellarers. And he was made subcellarer. But at the end of the year Roger rendered an account of his receipts and expenses, and declared that he had received sixty marks from the stock of the manors to supplement the deficit of the cellarer.

When Adam de Cokefield was dead,\engnotenum{} the abbot could have taken three hundred marks for the wardship of the only daughter of Adam; but as the grandfather of the maid had secretly removed her, and the abbot could not obtain possession of her person, save with the held of the archbishop, he granted that wardship to Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, on receipt of a hundred pounds.

\switchcolumn*

\begin{otherlanguage}{latin}

\switchcolumn

The archbishop, when he had received five hundred marks, granted that wardship to Thomas de Burgh, brother of the chamberlain of the king, and the maiden was given to him with her right by the hand of the abbot. Thomas then at once sought seisin of three manors, which had been in our hand after the death of Adam, Cokefield, Semere, and Groton. We thought that we could retain them all in our demesne, or at least two of them,---Semere and Groton, both because Robert de Cokefield on his deathbed had publicly declared that he claimed no hereditary right in those two manors, and because his son Adam in full court had acknowledged our right to those two manors, and had given his charter on the point, wherein it was laid down that he held those two manors, by the grace of the monastery, for his life only.

When Thomas, then, sought a writ of recognition on the matter, he caused the knights to be summoned to come to make oath before the king at Tewkesbury. Our charters read in public had no weight, for the whole court was against us. And when oath had been made, the knights said that they knew nothing of our charters, or of private agreements; but they said that they believed that Adam and his father and grandfather for a hundred years back had held the manors in fee-farm, and each after the other, on the days when they were alive and dead. So we were disseised by the judgment of the court after undergoing many labours and many expenses, though the old annual payments of rent were preserved.

While Robert the prior was ill and still lived, there was much talk as to the appointment of a new prior. Then one said that the lord abbot, sitting in the choir and beholding all the brothers, from the first to the last, had not found anyone on whom his spirit might rest to make him prior, save Heribert his chaplain. By these and other like things the will of the abbot was made clear to many. And on hearing this, another answered that this was incredible; he asserted that the abbot, a man diligent and provident, would never give the office of prior to such a man, who was a youth and almost a beardless novice twelve years before, who had only been a cloistered monk for four years, and who was not proved in the rule of souls.

Then when the prior was dead, the abbot was in London, and one said, ``A month has not yet passed since the abbot made Heribert chaplain and subsacristan, and when he gave that post to him in the chapel of St.\ Nicasius, he did so with a promise that if it were in any way possible to make him prior, he would devote all his care to doing so.'' Another heard this, and wishing to please the abbot and him who was to be prior, made request to many, both old and young, that when opportunity was given they would nominate Heribert, at least in conjunction with others, for the office of prior. And he swore that in this way they would please the abbot, for such was his will.

Erant autem multi, tam de senioribus quam de junioribus, qui eundem Herebertum hominem amabilem et affabilem asserebant, et dignum magno honore.

And there were, indeed, many both among the older and among the younger men, who asserted that the same Heribert was an amiable and affable man, and worthy of great honour. And there were others also, few indeed in number, but more praised in counsel and from the wiser section of the monastery, who wished for master Hermer, the subprior, a mature man, learned and eloquent, skilled and experienced in the rule of souls, who had then ruled the cloister with success for fourteen years, an approved subprior and one known. They wished, I say, that he might be preferred to the post of prior, according to the word of wisdom, Trust an experienced master. But the multitude secretly murmured to the contrary, saying that he was a man of ill temper, impatient, restless, turbulent, nervous, litigious, a disturber of the peace. And they mocked him, saying that ``the wisdom of a man appears in his patience.''

Item dixit aliquis: ``Hoc unum, tanquam scandalum, valde timendum est, ne supprior\footnote[\ddag]{\emph{si} excidisse videtur ante \emph{supprior}.} removeatur, clerici literati habitum religionis de cetero dedignentur suscipere penes nos, si forte contingat aliquam statuam mutam erigi, et truncum ligneum pr\ae{}ferri in tali conventu;'' et adjecit idem frater, dicens quod talis deberet esse prior nostri conventus, ut, si quid majoris oriretur qu\ae{}stionis de ecclesiasticis vel s\ae{}cularibus negotiis, abbate absente, ad priorem quasi ad majorem et discretiorem posset referri.

One also said, ``There is this one thing which, as it is a scandal, as it a scandal, must be greatly feared, that the sub-prior being removed, learned clerks may not condescend to receive the garb of religion among us, if perchance it happen that some dumb idol be raised up, and a wooden log preferred in so great a monastery.'' And the same brother added that such a man should be prior of our monastery that, if any matter connected with some great question of ecclesiastical or secular business arose, while the abbot was absent, it might be referred to the prior as to one who was the highest and most discreet member.

Then the abbot returned and as he sat in the chapter, he put forward many things with sufficient eloquence as to the type of man who ought to be made prior. And John the third prior answered, in the presence of all, that the subprior was worthy, and a suitable person. But at once the multitude cried out, saying, ``Give us a man of peace, a man of peace.'' And two of us answered so great a multitude, and said that such a man ought to be appointed as knew how to rule souls, and to discern between leprosy and leprosy;\engnotenum{} and this speech was very displeasing since it seemed to favour the party of the subprior.

But the abbot, hearing this tumult, said that he would, after chapter, hear the advice of all men, that so he might proceed wisely in the matter, and on the morrow would settle the affair as he would. And meanwhile one said that the abbot was proceeding with this ceremony that he might cautiously prevent the subprior from obtaining the office of prior, but as if this had been done by the advice of the monastery, and not by the will of the abbot, and that the abbot himself might be held as excused.

When the morrow came, the abbot sat in the chapter and wept bitterly. And he said that he had not slept all that night, owing to his anxiety and fear lest he might nominate someone who should not be pleasing to God; and he swore on the peril of his soul that he would nominate four of us, who according to his opinion were the most fitted and suitable, that we might choose one of the four. Then the abbot named first the sacristan, of whom he knew well that he was a weak and incompetent man, as the sacristan himself witnessed with an oath. And at once before us all he named John the third prior, his relative, and Maurice his chaplain, and the said Heribert, all of whom were full young, about forty years old or less, and all of moderate intelligence, and men who needed to learn, rather than to teach, the rule of souls, though they were ready to learn.

The abbot nominated these three and put them forward, and he passed over the subprior and many other of the senior monks, who were older, more experienced, learned, and who included those who had formerly been masters of schools, and all the others. Then the abbot spoke at length and highly commended the person of John, but yet put forward also the opposite opinion, saying that the number of his relatives in this district would be a weight round his neck if he were made prior.

And as the abbot was ready to say the same of Maurice, as he could do, and thus craftily proceed to the mention of Heribert, his speech was interrupted, one of the older men of the monastery saying, ``Master precentor, it is yours to speak first; nominate lord Heribert.'' Then the precentor said, ``He is a good man.'' And when he heard the name of Heribert, the abbot ceased speaking, and turning to the precentor said, ``I will readily receive Heribert, if it is your wish.''

At these words the whole monastery cried out, ``He is a good man; he is a good man and lovable.'' And many of the older men witnessed this same thing, and at once the precentor and some friend with him, and two others from the other side, rose with all haste and placed Heribert in the midst.

But Heribert at first humbly begged to be excused, saying that he was unable to support so great an office, and especially, as he said, because he was not so well instructed as to be able to preach in the chapter, as the prior ought to do.

But the abbot said much to console him, and as it were, in prejudice of learned men, saying that he was well able to remember and consider the sermons of others, as others did.

And when he had so spoken, the newly received prior went to the feet of the abbot, and kissed them.

When the chapter was ended, I was sitting as guest-master in the porch of the guest-house, and I was amazed and revolved in my mind that which I had seen and heard. And I began to think subtly for what reason and for what special merits, such a man deserved to be promoted to so great a position. And I began to reflect that he was a man of comely stature and personal appearance, that he was a handsome man and had a kindly face; that he was always cheerful, and showed a smiling face early and late, and friendly to all men; that he was quiet in his manner, sober in his walk, polite in speech, with a sweet voice for chanting and good for reading. I reflected that he was young, strong, and sound in health, and fitted to labour for the needs of the church; that he knew how to suit himself to place and time, at one moment to laymen, at another to clerks, at another to the regular clergy, and at another to the secular men; that he was liberal, sociable, and facile; that he was not spiteful in punishing, nor suspicious, nor greedy, nor tiring, nor lazy. I reflected that he was sober, and a fluent speaker in the French tongue, as he was a Norman by birth; that he was a man of fair intelligence, who, if learning would not drive him mad, at least could be called a man of absolute probity.

The dean of London\engnotenum{} writes as follows in his chronicles:---``King Henry the Second, having a discussion as to the vacant abbacies with the archbishop and bishops, so observed the rule of the canons in the matter of appointing abbots, as to make use of votes obtained from other houses. Perhaps he thought that if pastors were everywhere created by their own body, the familiarity which had been contracted before election would lead to impunity for vices; equality glosses over faults; and there will be too much slackness in the cloisters.''

Another has said, ``It does not seem right that a pastor should be chosen from his own house, but rather from another. For if he be taken from another house, he will ever believe, according to size of the monastery which he has undertaken to rule, that many are wise, and will seek their counsel, if he be a good man, and if he be an evil man, he will fear their virtue. But a member of the house knows fully the ignorance, weakness and incompetence of all, and he will raven with the greater security, mingling square with round.''

In the year of grace one thousand two hundred and one, the abbot of Flaix\engnotenum{} came to us, who with the assent of the abbot, and by his own preaching, caused public buyings and sellings which had taken place on Sundays in the market place to be abandoned, and it was decreed that they should be held on Mondays. The same abbot did the like in many cities and boroughs of England.

And in the same year, the monks of Ely set up a market for buying and selling at Lakenheath, for which they had the assent and charter of the king. But we, at first, with our friends and neighbours, labouring peacefully, sent messengers to the chapter of Ely, and also at first letters to the lord of Ely, praying that they would desist from that which had been begun. And we added that we would in a friendly manner pay the fifteen marks which had been given for the charter obtained from the king, for the sake of peace, and for the securing of the maintenance of mutual affection. What more need be said? They would not desist, and threatening words went to and fro, and spears threatened spears.

But we received a writ of recognition as to whether that market had been established to the prejudice of ourselves and to the injury of the market town of St.\ Edmund's. And oath was made, and it was protested that this was done to our injury. And when it was told to the king, the king caused inquest to be made by his registrar as to the kind of charter which he had given to the monks of Ely, and it was found that he had given them the said market under this condition, that it should not be to the detriment of the neighbouring markets.

However, the king, when forty marks were promised to him, made us a charter that no market should henceforth be made within the liberty of St.\ Edmund, without the assent of the abbot. And he wrote to Geoffrey FitzPeter, the justiciar, that the market of Lakenheath should be destroyed. Then the justiciar wrote to the sheriff of Suffolk to the same effect.

And the sheriff, knowing that he was not able to enter the liberties of St.\ Edmund, nor to exercise any power there, sent this to the abbot by his writ, that this same thing might be carried out according to the command of the king.

So the bailiff of the hundred came thither on the market day with the witness of the free men, and publicly forbade that market in the name of the king, and exhibited the letters of the king and of the sheriff. But being assailed with abuse and injuries, he departed without performing his work. But the abbot put off the matter for a time, and when he was in London, consulted the wise men on the point. Then he sent word to his bailiffs that they should take the men of St.\ Edmund, with horses and arms, and destroy the market, and if they found any buying or selling, they should bring them in bonds with them.

So at midnight, there went out almost six hundred men, well armed, making their way towards Lakenheath. But when the spies told that they were coming, all those who were in the market dispersed hither and thither, and not one was found. On the same night, however, the prior of Ely came with his officials, as he suspected the coming of our men, that he might defend so far as he could those who were selling and buying, but would not leave his lodging. And when our bailiffs demanded from him surety and pledge that he would stand his trial in the court of St.\ Edmund for the injury which he had done, and he would not give it, having taken counsel, they overthrew the shambles of the butchers and the stalls in the market, and carried them away with them; and they took with them all the cattle, sheep, and oxen, yea, and all the beasts of the field, and made their way towards Icklingham.

The bailiffs of the prior followed them, and asked for their cattle in pledge for fifteen days; and it was done as they asked. And within fifteen days there came a writ, in which the abbot was summoned to come to the exchequer to make answer for such a deed, and to the effect that the cattle which had been taken should in the meanwhile be sent back free. For the bishop of Ely,\engnotenum{} a man eloquent and cunning, had in person made complaint on this matter to the justiciar and to the magnates of England, saying that an unheard-of act of daring had been done in the land of St.\ Etheldreda in time of peace, whence also many were moved against the abbot.

Meanwhile also other causes of dispute arose between the bishop of Ely and the abbot. For when a youth of Glemesford was accused in the court of St.\ Edmund for a breach of the king's peace, and had long been sought, and in this county, at last the bishop's seneschal produced that youth, and sought the court of St.\ Etheldreda for him, showing the charters and liberties of his lord. But our bailiffs, when they claimed the right to try the case and the possession of such liberty, could not be heard. For the county court placed the matter in respite until it might be decided before the itinerant justices, so that St.\ Edmund was driven from his jurisdiction.

Now when the abbot heard of this he proposed to cross the sea, but as he was ill, he wished to put it off until the feast of the Purification.  And lo! on St.\ Agnes' day, there came a messenger from the king, bearing a brief from the lord pope,\engnotenum{} in which it was laid down that the lord of Ely and the abbot of St.\ Edmund's should make inquest concerning Geoffrey FitzPeter and William de Stuteville and certain other magnates of England, who had taken the cross, and for whose absolution the lord king made request, alleging the infirmity of their health, and the need of their advice for the preservation of his realm. And the same messenger bore letters of the lord king,\engnotenum{} ordering that when the letters had been read, the abbot should come to speak with him concerning the message of the lord pope.

Then the abbot was disturbed, and said, ``I am straitened on every side. I must offend either God or the king. By the true God, come what may, I will not knowingly lie.'' And so he came home with all speed, being rather weak with illness of body and mind, and being humbled and timid, contrary to his usual manner, by means of the prior, he sought counsel of us, which he had very rarely done hitherto. And he asked what was to be done about the threatened liberties of the church, and whence the expenses might be provided if he were to undertake this journey, and to whom the custody of the abbey should be given, and what was to be done as to the poor servants who had long time served him.

And it was answered that he should go in person, and that he should borrow enough money, which should be paid from our sacristry and pittances, and from our other revenues according to his will.

And when he had heard such counsel, he was pleased, and so it was done.

Meanwhile we heard some murmuring and saying that the abbot was careful and thoughtful for his barony, but as to the liberties of the monastery, which we had lost in his time, that is, for the loss of the court and liberties of the cellarer, and for the liberties of the sacristan in the matter of the appointment of the bailiffs of the town by the monastery, he said nothing. Therefore the Lord stirred up the spirit of three brothers of moderate intelligence, and they, having roused many others, came to consult the prior on this matter, that on his departure the abbot might provide for the indemnity of his church in respect of her liberties.

When the abbot heard this, he answered many things which must not be spoken, swearing that he would be lord while he lived. But when vespers came, he spoke gently on the matter with the prior. And on the morrow, as he was about to depart and came to seek leave, as he sat in the chapter, he said that he had satisfied all his servants, and had made his will, as if he were then about to die. Then beginning to speak concerning the liberties of the church, he excused himself, saying that he had changed the ancient customs lest there might be a defect in the king's justice. And he cast the blame on the sacristan, and said that if Durand the bailiff, who was then ill, should die, the sacristan should hold the bailiwick in his own hand, and should appoint a bailiff in the presence of the chapter, as had been the ancient custom, provided that this were done by the counsel of the abbot. But he would in nowise return the gifts and presents annually made by the bailiff.

And when we asked what was to be done in the matter of the court of the cellarer which had been lost, and especially as to the pence which the cellarer had been wont to receive for the renewal of pledges, he grew angry at this, and asked by what authority we exacted the right of royal justice, and those things which pertain to the royal powers. And the answer was that we had always had this from the foundation of the church, and even for three years after he received the abbacy, and that we had this liberty still in all our manors for the renewal of pledges. And we said that we ought not to lose our right for the hundred shillings which he privately received each year from the bailiff, and we boldly demanded that we should have such seisin as we had in his day.

With these words tranquillity was restored, but not for long, since, ``Any man may be rich in promises.''

For Dunstan, Lord Archbishop of the holy metropolitan Church of Canterbury, ripe, sooth to say, in character as in age, Abbo of Fleury, a monk in deacon's orders, though unworthy, bespeaks the dews of the blessing of Christ the Lord above and below. After I had departed from you, venerable father, with much cheerfulness of heart, and had returned with haste to the monastery that you wot of, the brethren, with whom, being detained by their fraternal kindness, I have hitherto been staying as a guest, began to press me urgently to comply with their saintly desire, that I would reduce to writing the Passion of the miracle-worker, Eadmund, king and martyr. This, they declared, would be edifying to future generations, and acceptable to you, as well as a serviceable memento of my humble self among the English churches. They had heard, indeed, that the story of this Passion, which is unknown to most people, and has been committed to writing by none, had been related by your Holiness, as collected from ancient tradition, in my presence, to the Lord Bishop of Rochester, and to the Abbot of the monastery which is called Malmesbury, and to other brethren then assembled in accordance with your practice, whom you cease not to nourish with the food of God's word, alike in the Latin and in the mother tongue. To them you averred, while the tears ran from your eyes, that you had in your youth learned the history from a broken-down veteran, who in relating it, simply and in good faith, to the most glorious English king, Athelstan, declared on his oath that, on the very day on which the martyr laid down his life for Christ's sake, he had been armour-bearer to the saintly hero. In view of the great reliance which you placed on the old man's assertions, and which led you to store up his words in their entirety in the receptacle of your memory, to be uttered at a later date with honeyed accents to a younger generation, the brethren insisted strongly, notwithstanding my diffidence, that I would satisfy their earnest desire, and to the best of my ability preserve from utter oblivion so important a series of events. I felt that I could not with due self-respect refuse their request, and therefore, postponing for the moment the study of secular literature, I betook myself as it were to the esoteric wisdom of the spirit, and undertook to describe the good deeds of the king, who addicted himself on the throne of his kingdom to the truest philosophy, but especially those which, unparalleled in the world's history, were wrought after his death; to which none would give credence were they not vouched for by the irrefragable authority of your assertion. In truth, when you, the snows of whose head compel belief, made mention of the still continuing incorruption of the king's body, one of those present anxiously raised the question whether such things were possible? In order to clear up the doubt involved in that question, you alleged, from the ample stores of your experience, the instance (which still more powerfully struck the astonished minds of your auditors) of Cuthbert, the Saint of the

In this I found an admirable proof, which led me with more assurance to the careful relation of the holy king's actions, inspired as I was with full trust in his and your incomparable merits. And so, in dedicating to you the first fruits of my labour, I humbly beseech you to be so good as to bestow upon me, if it be but one day of your leisure in so worthy a cause, retrenching what is in excess, and supplying what is in defect, since, with the exception of the last miracle of the series, I have in every particular composed the narrative, as you delivered it, faithfully following a faithful informant, and exhorting all to the love of so eminent a martyr.

Involved in frequent wars, they defended themselves and their clients with courage; but as the latter were given over to sloth, and stayed at home, as might be expected of a proletariat, absorbed in pleasure alone, trusting to the unconquered bravery of the hireling soldiery whom they had retained, the protectors took counsel for the expulsion from home and country of the wretched natives. And so it was done; the Britons were turned out, and the alien conquerors set to work to parcel out among themselves the island, replete, as it was, with wealth of every kind, on the ground that it was a shame that it should be retained under the rule of a lazy populace, when it might afford a competent livelihood to men of mettle who were fit to defend themselves. The occasion having thus arisen, the eastern part of the island, which, even to this day, is called ``Eastengle,'' in the speech of the Angles, fell to the lot of the Saxons, while the Jutes and Angles parted in other directions, in which they could follow the clues of their own fortunes,\linebreak{}

But the above-mentioned eastern part attracts consideration for the following among other reasons, viz.\ that it is washed by waters on almost every side, girdled as it is on the south and east by the ocean, and on the north by an immense tract of marsh and fen, which starting, owing to the level character of the ground, from practically the midmost point of Britain, slopes for a distance of more than a hundred miles, intersected by rivers of great size, to the sea. But on the side where the sun sets, the province is in contact with the rest of the island, and on that account accessible; but as a bar to constant invasion by an enemy, a foss sunk in the earth is fortified by a mound equivalent to a wall of considerable height. In the interior the soil is rich and extremely productive, and delightfully pleasant with its gardens and woods, while it is noted for its excellent sport, and for its abundant grazing for flocks and herds. I pass over its rivers, which abound in fish, as on one side, as has been mentioned, the country is lapped by the sea, and on the other, where the marshes are spread out, stretch after stretch of the fen waters, as much as two or three miles in breadth, trickles past.

But, to revert to our subject, over this fertile province reigned the most holy, and, in God's sight, acceptable Prince Eadmund. He was sprung from the noble stock of the Old Saxons, and from his earliest childhood cherished most sincerely the Christian faith. Descended from a line of kings, and endued with a high character, he was, by the unanimous choice of all his fellow-provincials, not so much elected in due course of succession, as forced to rule over them with the authority of the sceptre. He was in truth of a comely aspect, apt for sovereignty; and his countenance continually developed fresh beauty through the tranquil devotion of his most serene spirit. To all he was affable and winning in speech, and distinguished by a captivating modesty; and he dwelt among his contemporaries with admirable kindness, though he was their lord, and without any touch of haughtiness or pride.

How beneficent he was in relation to his subjects, when he had been raised to the throne, and how strict in dealing with wrong-doers, it is beyond my abilities to describe; indeed I could not in suitable language set forth even the least of his merits. It may be said that he so combined the gentleness and simplicity of the dove with the wariness and sagacity of the serpent, that he was neither deceived by the fraudulent pretences of the old enemy of mankind, nor sanctioned the iniquitous sophisms of evilly-minded men. Any matter of which he was ignorant he would investigate with the utmost industry; and proceeding along the royal road, he deviated neither to the right through too exalted a notion of his own merits, nor to the left by falling a victim to the faults of human frailty. In addition, he was liberal in his bounty to those in want, and like a benignant father to the orphan and the widow. He ever kept in view the dictum of the wise man: ``Have they made you a prince? be not exalted, but be among them as one of them.''

With this object he despatched one of his own satellites as an adversary to Eadmund, in the hope that, stripped of all his possessions, the king might be goaded into an outburst of impatience, and in despair curse God to His face. This adversary was known by the name of Inguar; and he, with another called Hubba, a man of equal depravity, attempted (and nothing but the divine compassion could have prevented them) to reduce to destruction the whole confines of Britain. And no wonder! seeing that they came hardened with the stiff frost of their own wickedness from that roof of the world where he had fixed his abode who in his mad ambition sought to make himself equal to the Most High. In fine it is proverbial, according to the prediction of the prophet, that from the north comes all that is evil, as those have had too good cause to know, who through the spite of fortune and the fall of the die have experienced the barbarity of the races of the north. These, it is certain, are so cruel by the ferocity of their nature, as to be incapable of feeling for the ills of mankind; as is shown by the fact that some of their tribes use human flesh for food, and from the circumstance are known by the Greek name Anthropophagists. Nations of this kind abound in great numbers in Scythia, near the Hyperborean Mountains, and are destined, as we read, more than all other races, to follow Antichrist, and to batten without compunction on the agonies of men who refuse to bear on their foreheads the mark of the beast. Hence it results that they can observe no truce in harrying the worshippers of Christ, and this is true especially of the Danes, who, dwelling fatally near to the western regions, indulge continually in piratical raids upon them. Of this nation were the generals Inguar and Hubba, whom I have mentioned above. They set out in the first instance to attack the province of Northumbria, and overran the whole district from one end to the other, inflicting upon it the heaviest devastation. None of the inhabitants could resist these abominable onslaughts, but suffered the too well merited chastisement of the divine wrath through the instrumentality of Hubba the agent of iniquity. Having raked together their booty, Inguar left on the spot Hubba, his associate in cruelty, and approaching (East Anglia) suddenly with a great fleet, landed by stealth at a city in that region, entered it before the citizens were aware of his approach, and set it on fire.

Husband and wife lay dead or dying together on their thresholds; the babe snatched from its mother's breast was, in order to multiply the cries of grief, slaughtered before her eyes. An impious soldiery scoured the town in fury, athirst for every crime by which pleasure could be given to the tyrant who from sheer love of cruelty had given orders for the massacre of the innocent.

At length when the impious Inguar had slain such numbers that he had, I will not say satisfied his Achimenian madness, but from weariness deferred for a while its complete gratification, he summoned a few poor wretches whom he judged to be not worth killing, and by searching cross-examination of them endeavoured to ascertain whereabouts their king was at that time residing. It seems that a report had reached him that the glorious King Eadmund, who was in the prime of life, and in the fulness of vigour, was a keen soldier. On this account Inguar made it his business to cut off all the men whom he could find round about, so that the king, deprived of the support of a compact force for the defence of his kingdom, should be unable to offer effective resistance. Eadmund, it happened, was at that time staying at some distance from the city, in a township which in the native language is called H\ae{}gelisdun, from which also the neighbouring forest is called by the same name. The monster of impiety calculated, as was indeed the truth, that whatever number of the natives his murderous minions could succeed in destroying, so many the less would there be, if it came to a pitched battle, for the king to lead against his foes. Moreover, Inguar did not venture to leave his fleet without a strong guard; for, just as the wolf is accustomed to steal in the evening down to the plains, and to return with haste by night to\linebreak{}

On hearing this, the most saintly king groaned in profound grief of mind, and hailing one of his bishops, who was his confidential adviser, consulted with him as to the answer which was proper to be returned to the demands preferred. The bishop, alarmed for the safety of the king, used a number of arguments in favour of compliance; but the king, staggered by such advice, and fixing his eyes on the ground, was silent for a little while. Then finally he spoke his mind as follows: ``Bishop, I have reached a point in my life of which I never had any apprehension. See! a barbarous stranger with drawn sword menaces the old occupants of my realm, and the once prosperous natives are reduced to sighs and groans and silence. Would that those who now live in dread of perishing by a bloody death might be spared to survive amid the beloved fields of their country, even though I should fall, and that they might in course of time be restored to the brightness of their former prosperity.'' Here the bishop interposed: ``How can you speak of survivors in the land, seeing that the enemy's sword has left scarcely one alive in the whole city? Their axes are blunted with the slaughter of your subjects; you are left without a guard, and they will bind you fast with thongs. And therefore, my sovereign, dear to me as my soul, unless you seek safety in flight, or have recourse to the ill-omened alternative of surrender, I fear the tormentors will soon arrive, and you will forfeit your life through the unholy execution of their orders.'' ``That,'' answered the king, ``is what I desire; that is my dearest wish, not to survive my loyal and dear subjects, who have been bereft of their lives and massacred with their children and their wives as they lay in bed, by a bloodthirsty brigand. And what do you advise? that in life's extremity, bereft of my comrades, I should besmirch my fair fame by taking to flight? I have always avoided the calumnious accusations of the informer; never have I endured the opprobrium of fleeing from the battlefield, realising how glorious it would be for me to die for my country; and now I will of my own free will surrender myself, for the loss of those dear to me has made light itself hateful. The Almighty disposer of events is present as my witness that, whether I live or die, nothing shall separate me from the love of Christ, the ring of whose faith I took on me in the sacrament of baptism, when I renounced Satan and all his vanities. And by that renunciation it ensued that I gained a triple title to be devoted to the praise and glory of the Eternal Trinity, having been cleansed with a view to the reward of endless life by the anointing of the consecrated chrism. Firstly, to wit, I put on the robes proper for the font of healing; in the second place, I received confirmation with the larger episcopal signet; and thirdly, by general acclaim of yourself and the people at large, I acquired the sovereign power of this realm. And thus bedewed in threefold manner\linebreak{}

with the ointment of mystic consecration, I have determined to be the benefactor rather than the ruler of the English Commonwealth, in scorning to bow my neck to any yoke but that of the service of God. It is with a mere pretence of good-will that my cunning foe now spreads the meshes of his machinations, by which he calculates on ensnaring the servant of Christ, above all when he promises that which the divine bounty has already conferred upon me. He allows me life, for which I no longer care; he promises me a kingdom, that I already possess; he would bestow on me riches, of which I have no need. Is it for these things that I am now to begin serving two masters---I who have dedicated myself before my whole court to live and to rule under Christ alone?''

Tunc conversus ad eum qui de conditione regni locuturus ab impiissimo Inguar fuerat missus, ``Madefactus,'' inquit, ``cruore meorum mortis supplicio dignus extiteras; sed plane Christi mei exemplum secutus nolo puras commaculare manus, qui pro ejus nomine, si ita contigerit, libenter paratus sum vestris telis occumbere. Ideo pernici gradu rediens festinus domino tuo h\ae{}c responsa perfer quantocius. Bene, fili diaboli, patrem tuum imitaris, qui superbiendo intumescens c\oe{}lo corruit, et mendacio suo humanum genus involvere gestiens, plurimos p\oe{}n\ae{} su\ae{} obnoxios fecit. Cujus sectator pr\ae{}cipuus, me nec minis terrere pr\ae{}vales, nec bland\ae{} perditionis lenociniis illectum decipies, quem Christi institutis non inermem repperies. Thesauros et divitias quas nobis hactenus contulit propitia divinitas, sumat consumatque tua insatiabilis aviditas, quoniam etsi hoc corpus caducum fragile confringas velut vas fictile, vera libertas animi numquam tibi vel ad momentum suberit. Honestius enim est perpetuam defendere libertatem, si non armis saltem jugulis, quam reposcere amissam lacrimosis querimoniis, quoniam pro altero gloriosum est mori, pro altero vero opponitur contumacia servilis. Quippe servus, quascumque domini conditiones accepit, acceptas servare convenit; si eas quamlibet iniquas respuit, reus majestatis adjudicatur servilibus suppliciis. Sed esto; gravis est hujus servitutis usus; at gravior exulceratio qu\ae{} solet nasci ex hujusmodi infortunio; siquidem, ut noverunt qui frequentius ratiocinando forensibus causis intersunt, ex repugnantibus facta complexionis consequentia, certum est quia, si libertas petitur, proculdubio dominus suo contemptu l\ae{}ditur. Idcirco, seu sponte seu invitus, de carcere suo meus ad c\oe{}lum evolet liber spiritus, nulla emancipationis aut abalienationis specie contaminatus, quia regem diminutum capite nunquam, Danus, videbis ad triumphum supervivere. Sollicitas me spe regni, interfectis omnibus meis, ac si mihi tam dira sit cupido regnandi, ut velim pr\ae{}esse domibus vacuis habitatore nobili et pretiosa supellectili. Ut c\oe{}pit tua s\ae{}va feritas, post famulos regem solio diripiat, trahat, exspuat, colaphis c\ae{}dat, ad ultimum jugulet.

Then, turning to the messenger whom the impious Inguar had sent to announce the terms on which his kingdom might be retained, Eadmund exclaimed: ``Reeking as you are with the blood of my countrymen, you might justly be doomed to death; but to speak plainly, I would follow the example of Christ my Lord, and refrain from staining my pure hands; and for his name's sake, if the need arise, I am willing and glad to perish by your weapons. Therefore return as fast as you can at once to your lord, and take forthwith this message to him: `Son of the devil, well do you imitate your father, who through his swelling pride fell from heaven, and striving to involve mankind in his falseness, rendered multitudes liable to his punishment. You, his chief follower, are powerless to terrify me by threats, nor shall you deceive me with the snares and sophistries that inveigle to destruction, for you will not find me lacking the armour of Christian principles. As for the treasures and the wealth, which till now God's favour has bestowed on me, take and squander them as your insatiable greed may prompt, since, even though you should break in pieces this frail and perishable body, like a potter's vessel, my soul, which is truly free, will never for a moment submit to you. For it is more honourable to champion the cause of perpetual freedom, if not with arms, at any rate with life, than to spend tearful complaints in redemanding it when lost, since in the one case death is glorious, but in the other the opposition is but the rebellion of slaves. That is to say, a slave, whatever terms he may have accepted at the hands of his master, is bound to observe them as he accepted them; if he repudiates them, iniquitous though they may be, he is guilty of treason, and is liable to the punishment of a slave. But enough; grievous as may be the burden of such a servitude, still more grievous is the rankling sore which misfortune of this kind usually begets, seeing that, as is within the knowledge of those who, as advocates, are practised in the discussion of cases in the law-courts, when a conclusion is deduced from repugnant circumstances, it is certain that, if freedom be aimed at, the tyrant is undoubtedly prejudiced by contempt of himself. Consequently, willingly or unwillingly, let my free spirit wing its way from its prison to heaven, untainted by any appearance of sale or surrender; for be assured, Dane, you shall never see me, a king, survive the loss of freedom to adorn your triumph. You ply me with expectations of a continued reign, after the\linebreak{}

slaughter of all my people, as if I were possessed by so mad a lust of rule, that I could have the heart to reign over houses emptied of their noble inhabitants: their precious garniture. Let your savage ferocity go on as it has begun: after the subjects let the king be snatched from his throne, dragged away, spat upon, struck and buffeted, and finally butchered. The King of kings sees all that with compassion, and will, I am confident, translate the victim to reign with him in life eternal. Know, therefore, that for the love of this earthly life Eadmund, the Christian king, will not submit to a heathen chief, unless you first become a convert to our religion; he would rather be a standard-bearer in the camp of the Eternal King.'\hspace{1pt}''

Vix sanctus vir verba compleverat, et renuntiaturus miles pedem domo extulerat, cui ecce Inguar obvius jubet breviloquio ut utatur, illi pandens per omnia arcana regis ultima. Qu\ae{} ille dum exequitur, imperat tyrannus circumfundi omnem turbam suorum exterius, solumque regem teneant, quem suis legibus rebellem jam cognoverat. Tunc sanctus rex Eadmundus in palatio, ut membrum Christi, projectis armis capitur, et vinculis arctioribus arctatus constringitur, atque innocens sistitur ante impium ducem quasi Christus ante Pilatum pr\ae{}sidem, cupiens ejus sequi vestigia, qui pro nobis immolatus est hostia.

The saintly man had but just ended his speech, and the soldier taken his departure from the palace to carry back the answer, when, behold! Inguar met him, and bade him waste no words in declaring the final purport of the king's reply. As the messenger obeyed this behest, the tyrant ordered the crowd of his attendants to form a ring round the place, and to take the king alone prisoner, as showing palpable defiance of the conditions laid down. Then the holy King Eadmund was taken in his palace, as a member of Christ, his weapons thrown aside, and was pinioned and tightly bound with chains, and in his innocence was made to stand before the impious general, like Christ before the governor Pilate, and eager to follow in the footsteps of Him who was sacrificed as a victim for us. And so in chains he was mocked in many ways, and at length,  being savagely beaten, he was brought to a tree in the neighbourhood, tied to it, and for a long while tortured with terrible lashes. But his constancy was unbroken, while without ceasing he called on Christ with broken voice. This roused the fury of his enemies, who, as if practising at a target, pierced his whole body with arrow-spikes, augmenting the severity of his torment by frequent discharges of their weapons, and inflicting wound upon wound, while one javelin made room for another. And thus, all haggled over by the sharp points of their darts, and scarce able to draw breath, he actually bristled with them, like a prickly hedgehog or a thistle fretted with spines, resembling in his agony the illustrious martyr Sebastian. But when it was made apparent to the villainous Inguar that not even by these means could the king be made to yield to the agents of his cruelty, but that he continued to call upon the name of Christ, the Dane commanded the executioner to cut off his head forthwith. The king was by this time almost lifeless, though the warm lifestream still throbbed in his breast, and he was scarcely able to stand erect. In this plight he was hastily wrenched from the blood-stained stem, his ribs laid bare by numberless gashes, as if he had been put to the torture of the rack, or had been torn by savage claws, and was bidden to stretch forth the head which had ever been adorned by the royal diadem. Then, as he stood in all his meekness, like a ram chosen out of the whole flock, and desirous of hastening by a happy exchange this life for eternity, absorbed as he was in the mercies of God, he was refreshed by the vision of the light within, for the satisfaction of which he earnestly yearned in his hour of agony. Thus, while the words of prayer were still on his lips, the executioner, sword in hand, deprived the king of life, striking off his head with a single blow. And so, on the \oldstylenums{20}th November, as an offering to God of sweetest savour, Eadmund, after he had been tried in the fire of suffering, rose with the palm of victory and the crown of righteousness, to enter as king and martyr the assembly of the court of heaven.

Thus in his departure from life, the king, following the footsteps of Christ his master, consummated that sacrifice of the Cross which he had endured continually in the flesh. Just as Christ, free from all taint of sin, left on the column to which he was bound, not for himself, but for us, the blood which was the mark of his scourging, so Eadmund incurred a like penalty bound to the blood-stained tree, for the sake of gaining a glory that fades not away. Christ, whose life was without stain, suffered in his great benignity the bitter pain of unmerciful nails in his hands and feet in order to cleanse away the foulness of our sins; Eadmund, for the love of the holy Name, with his whole body bristling with grievous arrows, and lacerated to the very marrow by the acutest tortures, steadfastly persisted in the avowal of his faith which in the end he crowned by undergoing the doom of death. The Danes, with their instigator, instruments of the devil, left his body mutilated, as has been described, and transfixed with javelins, while the sacred head, which had been anointed not with the oil of sinners, but with the sacramental chrism of mystery, was carried by them as they retired into a wood, the name of which is Haglesdun, and was thrown as far as possible among the dense thickets of brambles, and so hidden; the Danes contriving this with the greatest cunning, so that the Christians, but few of whom were left alive, should not be able to commit to such decent burial their limited means of interment would allow, the sanctified body of the martyr conjoined with the head.

Of this appalling scene there was present as a spectator, though in hiding, one of our religion, who was rescued, as I believe, by God's providence from the swords of the heathen, and so preserved to bring to light the traces of these events, although he was entirely ignorant what had been done with the head, beyond the fact that he had seen the Danes betaking themselves with it into the depths of the wood. Accordingly, when peace of some sort had been restored to the churches, the Christians began to emerge from their hiding-places, and to make diligent and busy search with the intention of joining the head of their king and martyr, when found, to the rest of the body, and laying them to rest with due honour according to their means. And so, on the departure of the heathen, who engaged in the work of devastation elsewhere, the sacred body, still lying above ground, was with no difficulty found in the very field where the king died, when he finished the course of his trial. Thither, spurred by the recollection of former benefits, and of the gentle nature of their king, the populace, coming together from all directions, began with rueful hearts to lament the loss of so important a part of the body. Inspiration came by benign suggestion from above; and, after listening to the helpful narrative of the witness who had, as I have said, been a witness of the dreadful scene, they united in great numbers to institute a search in every part of the wood's recesses, in the hope of reaching by hazard the spot where the head of their holy hero was lying. All who were possessed of true insight were confident that the Danes, as worshippers of strange gods, had out of spite to our faith abstracted the head of the martyr, which they had probably hidden not very far away in the dense thicket, and had left concealed by the coarse undergrowth a prey to birds and beasts. A council was held, and all unanimously agreed upon a plan; it was decided that each individual should be accoutred with horn or pipe, so that the searchers, in their explorations hither and thither, could by calling or by the noise of their instruments signal one to another, and so avoid going twice over the same ground, or missing some localities altogether.

When they carried out this plan, a thing happened marvellous to relate, and unheard of in the course of ages. The head of the holy king, far removed from the body to which it belonged, broke into utterance without assistance from the vocal chords, or aid from the arteries proceeding from the heart. A number of the party, like corpse-searchers, were gradually examining the out-of-the-way parts of the wood, and when the moment had arrived at which the sound of the voice could be heard, the head, in response to the calls of the search-party mutually encouraging one another, and as comrade to comrade crying alternately ``Where are you?'' indicated the place where it lay by exclaiming in their native tongue, Here!\ Here!\ Here! In Latin the same meaning would be rendered by Hic!\ Hic!\ Hic! And the head never ceased to repeat this exclamation, till all were drawn to it. The chords of the dead man's tongue vibrated within the passages of the jaws, thus displaying the miraculous power of Him who was born of the Word, and endowed the braying ass with human speech, so that it rebuked the madness of the prophet. And to this miracle the Creator of the world added another by attaching an unwonted guardian to the heavenly treasure. In fact, a monstrous wolf was by God's mercy found in that place, embracing the holy head between its paws, as it lay at full length on the ground, and thus acting as sentinel to the martyr. Nor did it suffer any animal whatever to injure its charge, but, forgetful of its natural voracity, preserved the head from all harm with the utmost vigilance, lying outstretched on the earth. This was witnessed with astonishment by the crowd which had assembled, and they recognised in the most blessed king and martyr Eadmund a worthy parallel to that enviable man who, unharmed among the gaping jaws of hungry lions, laughed to scorn the threats of those who had plotted his destruction.

Lifting up, therefore, with concordant devotion the pearl of inestimable price which they had discovered, and shedding floods of tears for joy, they brought back the head to its body, blessing God with hymns and lauds, while the wolf, which was the guardian and bearer of the relic, followed them to the place of entombment, and keeping close behind them, though seemingly grieved for the loss of the pledge it had had in keeping, neither did harm to any one though provoked, nor gave trouble to any one, but again betook itself unharmed to the familiar seclusion of its congenial solitude; and never afterwards was there seen in that neighbourhood any wolf so terrible in appearance. When the wolf had retired, those who were intrusted with the duty, with the utmost care and with all possible zeal and skill provisionally fitted the head to the sacred body, and committed the two joined together to a becoming sepulchre. And there they built over the grave a chapel of rude construction, in which the body rested for many years, until the conflagration of war and the mighty storms of persecution were over, and the religious piety of the faithful began to revive, upon relief from the pressure of tribulation. And so, when a seasonable opportunity was found, they displayed in many ways the devotion which they cherished in regard to the blessed king and martyr Eadmund. They were stirred by the occurrence of marvellous works. For the Saint, from beneath the lowly roof of his consecrated abode, made manifest by frequent miraculous signs the magnitude of his merits in the sight of God. These events aroused great numbers of the inhabitants of that province, high and low alike; and in the royal town which, in the English tongue, is named Bedrices-gueord, but in Latin is called Bedrici-curtis, they erected a church of immense size, with storeys admirably constructed of wood, and to this they translated him with great magnificence, as was due.

Sed, mirum dictu! cum illud pretiosum corpus martyris putrefactum putaretur ob diuturnum spatium transacti temporis, ita sanum et incolume repertum est, ut non dicam redintegratum et compactum corpori, sed omnino in eo nichil vulneris, nichil cicatricis apparuerit. Sicque cum reverentia nominatus sanctus rex et martyr Eadmundus, integer et viventi simillimus, ad pr\ae{}dictum locum est translatus, ubi adhuc in eadem forma expectat beat\ae{} resurrectionis gaudia repromissa. Tantum in ejus collo ob signum martyrii rubet una tenuissima ruga in modum fili coccinei, sicut testari erat solita qu\ae{}dam beat\ae{} recordationis f\oe{}mina, Oswen vocabulo dicta, qu\ae{} paulo ante h\ae{}c nostra moderna tempora, apud ejus sacrosanctum tumulum jejuniis et orationibus vacans, multa transegit annorum cur[r]icula.

But, marvellous to tell, whereas it was supposed that the precious body of the martyr would have mouldered to dust in the long interval of time which had elapsed, it was found to be so sound and whole that it would be out of place to speak of the head having been restored to and united with the body, for there was absolutely no trace apparent of wound or scar. And so the king and martyr Eadmund was with reverence pronounced to be a Saint, and was translated whole and entire, and wearing every semblance of life, to the place above mentioned, where to this day without change of form he awaits the covenanted felicity of a blessed resurrection. One thing only is to be noticed: round his neck, as an ensign of his martyrdom, there was seen an extremely thin red crease, like a scarlet thread, as was frequently attested by a certain woman of blessed memory called Oswen, who shortly before these recent times of ours passed many years in succession near his consecrated tomb, absorbed in fastings and prayers. This venerable woman, either from some divine intuition, or from excess of devotion, made it her constant practice to open the sepulchre of the blessed martyr year by year, at the anniversary of the Lord's Supper, and to trim and pare his hair and nails. These relics, one and all, she studiously collected, and stored in a casket; nor did she ever omit, as long as she lived, to cherish them with an affection that was wonderful, having placed them on the altar of the church to which I have referred. And there they are still preserved with due veneration.

Sed et beat\ae{} memori\ae{} Theodredus, ejusdem provinci\ae{} religiosus episcopus, qui propter meritorum pr\ae{}rogativam bonus appellabatur, quod de incorruptione sancti regis diximus tali ordine est expertus. Cum, ut narrare adorsi sumus, pr\ae{}fato loco martyris tumulationi congruo a quibusque religiosius multa conferrentur donaria et ornamenta, in auro et argento pretiosissimo, quidam malign\ae{} mentis homines, omnis boni immemores, aggressi sunt sub nocturno silentio eandem infringere basilicam latrocinandi studio. Fuerunt autem octo qui absque ulla reverentia sancti decreverant satisfacere su\ae{} vesan\ae{} voluntati, capiendo furtim omnia qu\ae{}cumque invenissent sibi utilia infra  ejusdem monasterii septa. Unde sumptis machinis et quibuslibet utensilibus quibus ad id perficiendum habebant opus, quadam nocte aggrediuntur pr\ae{}meditatum facinus, et stantes in atrio ecclesi\ae{} diverse conatu unusquisque concept\ae{} instat nequiti\ae{}. Quorum alius postibus scalam applicat, ut per insertam fenestram se ingerat; alius cum lima aut fabrili malleo instat ser\ae{} aut pessulo; alii cum vangis et ligonibus suffossionem parietis machinantur. Sicque disposito opere, cum singuli certatim insudant pro virium facultate, sanctus martyr eos ligat in ipso conamine, ut nec pedem loco possent movere, nec arreptum officium deserere, sed alius cum sua scala penderet sublimis in aere, alius palam incurvus fossor fieret, qui ad id opus furtivus venisset. Interea quidam matriculariorum qui infra basilicam jacebat, somno excitus, lecto procumbebat invitus, quem martyris potentia suo conatu vinxerat, ne suis obvius factis mirabilibus sonus fragoris creber custodis pulsaret aures interius. Sed quid dicam, non posse surgere, quando nec in vocem poterat erumpere? Tandem mane adhuc persistentes fures incepto operi comprehensi a pluribus traduntur vinculis arctioribus, et tandem pr\ae{}dicti sancti episcopi Theodredi judicio subduntur. Qui impremeditatus sententiam dedit, quam se dedisse postea omni tempore vit\ae{} su\ae{} p\oe{}nituit. Nam omnes simul jussit affigi patibulis, eo quod ausi fuissent atrium sancti Eadmundi martyris furtive ingredi; non reducens ad memoriam quod Dominus per prophetam admonet,\footnote{Proverbs xxiv.\ \oldstylenums{11}.} ``Eos qui ducuntur ad mortem eruere ne cesses;'' factum quoque Helisei\footnote{\oldstylenums{2} Kings vi.\ \oldstylenums{22}.} prophet\ae{}, qui latrunculos de Samaria pastos pane et aqua remisit ad propria, dicens regi volenti percutere ilico, quod non eos cepisset in gladio et arcu suo; Apostoli\footnote{\oldstylenums{1} Cor.\ vi.\ \oldstylenums{4}.} etiam pr\ae{}ceptum, quo dicit, S\ae{}cularia negotia si habueritis, contemptibiles qui sunt in ecclesia, id est, viros s\ae{}culares, constituite ad judicandum.

Quamobrem pr\ae{}dictus episcopus in se reversus graviter indoluit, et sibi p\oe{}nitentiam indicens diutius se in gravibus lamentis dedit.

Factumque est, et illud sanctissimi regis corpus ante dilaceratum et truncum, ita ut jam retulimus, unitum et incorruptum repperit, tetigit, lavit, et rursum novis et optimis vestibus indutum ligneo locello reposuit, benedicens Deum qui mirabilis est in sanctis suis et gloriosus in omnibus operibus suis.

There is, moreover, the evidence of Theodred of blessed memory, the pious bishop of the province, whose good deserts challenged for him the designation of ``the good.'' He verified, as is set out below, the fact which I have stated of the incorruption of the sainted king. Divers persons in their piety had contributed, as I had begun to relate, a number of offerings and ornaments in gold and silver of great value, to the place above mentioned as having been selected for the entombment of the martyr, when some men of depraved minds, and utterly forgetful of what was right, attempted under cover and in the silence of night to break into the temple of the king for the purpose of robbery. There were eight of these marauders who, totally wanting in reverence for the Saint, had determined to gratify their crazy cupidity by the theft of everything which they might find of use to themselves within the precincts of the monastery. They furnished themselves accordingly with whatever implements and tools they had that would be serviceable for the execution of this work, and one night attempted to carry out their premeditated crime. Posted in the fore-court of the church, each member of the gang applied himself in his several capacity to his share of the concerted outrage. Thus one laid a ladder to the door-posts, in order to climb through the window; another was engaged with a file, or a smith's hammer, on the bars and bolts; others with shovels and mattocks endeavoured to undermine the walls. The work being thus distributed, whilst they vied one with another in the most strenuous exertions, the holy martyr bound them fast in the midst of their efforts, so that they could neither stir from the spot nor abandon the task upon which they had entered; one on his ladder hung aloft in mid-air, another was displayed to view with his back bent in digging, who had stolen unobserved to the guilty deed. Meanwhile, one of the staff of attendants who was sleeping within the temple, though aroused from his slumbers, was kept a prisoner in his bed, restrained in his endeavour to rise by the martyr's power, so that no sound or noisy echo should reach the ears of the custodian within, and so impede the manifestation of the Saint's miraculous power. But I understate the facts when I say that the man could not rise, seeing that he could not so much as utter a word. At length morning came, and then the thieves, still persevering with the work which they had begun, were arrested by a number of people, and, after being firmly secured by chains, were finally committed to the above-mentioned holy bishop Theodred for trial. The bishop, through inadvertence, pronounced upon them a sentence of which he afterwards regretted the infliction for the whole of his life-time. In fact, he ordered the whole gang to be hanged together, because, for the purpose of theft, they had dared to invade the precincts of St.\ Eadmund the Martyr. But he failed to keep in mind the monition of God through his prophet, ``Cease not to deliver those who are appointed to die,'' and the action of Elisha the Prophet, who fed the robbers of Samaria with bread and water, and sent them to their own homes, saying to the king who was minded to slay them on the spot, that he had not taken them by means of his sword and his bow; and again, the injunction of the Apostle, in which he says, ``If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church,'' meaning thereby laymen. This is the origin of the canonical precept which forbids a bishop or any one in holy orders to discharge the function of an informer, as it is highly unbecoming that the ministers of the heavenly life should yield assent to the death of any man whatever. Consequently the bishop aforesaid, when he reflected on what he had done, was struck with profound remorse, and awarded penance against himself, remaining for a long while engrossed in deep contrition. At the end of his penance he issued a proclamation to the inhabitants of his diocese, and by the proclamation he convened them, and in convening, he begged and entreated them, by means of a three days' fast, to remove and avert from him the divine indignation and wrath, to the end that the Lord, being appeased by the sacrifice of a troubled spirit, should accord him grace, by which he might venture to touch and wash the body of the blessed martyr, who, though he blossomed with so many virtues when in the world, was nevertheless enshrined in a poor sepulchre, inadequate to his deserts. And so it was done; and the bishop found the body of the most holy king, which before had been lacerated and mutilated, as I have already related, whole and incorrupt; he handled it, he washed it, he clothed it afresh with new robes of the best, and replaced it in a wooden coffin, blessing God, who is wonderful in His saints and glorious in all His works.

I shall not, I hope, tire my readers if I mention the fate of a man of great position named Leofstan, who, unable to curb the impetuosity of youth, was carried to such a pitch of wanton wickedness that he demanded, in the exercise of his supreme authority, the exhibition to himself of the martyr's body. Although he was dissuaded by many persons, and chiefly by his own retainers, his command prevailed, as he was regarded with general dread on account of the pre-eminence of his rank. The coffin was opened; he stood by, he looked in, and at that very moment the Lord smote him with madness and gave him over to a reprobate mind. Thus he was taught by his punishment that his presumption had carried him beyond lawful bounds. This came to the ears of his father, a man of deep piety, whose name was \AE{}lfgar. He was appalled by the infamous crime of his son; and rendered thanks to the martyr, and turned his son out of doors. The latter was reduced at length to the depths of poverty, and by God's judgment was devoured by worms, and so brought his life to an end.

Sicque sanctus rex et martyr Eadmundus omnibus innotuit, non se esse inferiorem meritis Laurentii beati levit\ae{} et martyris, cujus corpus, ut refert beatus pater Gregorius, cum quidam, seu digni seu indigni, levare volentes conspicerent, contigit ut octo ex eis ibidem subita morte perirent. O quanta reverentia locus ille dignus extitit, qui sub specie dormientis tantum Christi testem continet, et in quo tant\ae{} virtutes fiunt et fact\ae{} esse referuntur, quantas hac tempestate apud Anglos nusquam alibi audivimus; quas ego brevitatis studio pr\ae{}tereo, ne alicujus fastidiosi offensam incurrerem, justo prolixior, credens ista sufficere qu\ae{} dicta sunt ardenti desiderio eorum qui, pr\ae{}ter Deum, hujus martyris patrocinio nil pr\ae{}ferunt. De quo constat, sicut et de aliis sanctis omnibus jam cum Christo regnantibus, quod licet ejus anima sit in c\oe{}lesti gloria, non tamen per visitationem die noctuque longe est a corporis pr\ae{}sentia, cum quo promeruit ea quibus jam perfruitur beat\ae{} immortalitatis gaudia. Nam dum in \ae{}terna patria ei jungitur qui ubique totus est, de eo habet posse quicquid habuerit et velle, pr\ae{}ter id solum quod infatigabili desiderio concupiscit, ut per resurrectionem circumdetur stola mutat\ae{} carnis; quoniam tunc erit perfecta beatitudo sanctorum, cum ad id fuerit Christo largiente perventum.

In such wise the holy king and martyr, Eadmund, demonstrated to the world that he was not inferior in merit to Lawrence, the blessed deacon and martyr. As has been related by the blessed Pope Gregory, certain persons, worthy or unworthy, inspected his body with the intention of exhuming it, and out of their number it befell that no less than eight perished on the spot by sudden death. Oh! what deep reverence was due to that place, which contains in the guise of one asleep so august a witness to Christ, and in which such wondrous works are said to have occurred, and do occur, as in these times we have heard of in no other part of England! For brevity's sake I pass over these, not being desirous of incurring by undue prolixity the resentment of any fastidious person, and in the belief that what has been related will satisfy the ardent wishes of those who deem nothing preferable to the patronage of this martyr, except God himself. It is fully proved in his case (as in that of all the other saints who already reign with Christ) that though his spirit be in the enjoyment of heavenly glory, yet it has power to revisit the body and is not by day or night far separated from the place where that body lies, in union with which it has earned the joys of a blessed immortality, of which even now it has the fruition. Doubtless, in its eternal home, where it is united to Him, who is integrally present everywhere, the spirit has from Him power proportioned to its capacity of will, besides the boon of boons which it covets with unwearying desire, that by the resurrection it should be enveloped with the garment of the flesh transformed; since then will the beatitude of the saints be perfected, when that consummation shall have been attained through the bounty of Christ.

And how great was the holiness in this life of the holy martyr may be conjectured from the fact that his body even in death displays something of the glory of the resurrection without trace of decay; for it must be borne in mind that they who are endued with this kind of distinction are extolled by the Catholic Fathers in the rolls of their religion as having attained the peculiar privilege of virginity, for they teach that such as have preserved their chastity till death, and have endured the stress of persecution even to the goal of martyrdom, by a just recompense are endued even here on earth, when death is past, with incorruption of the flesh. What, indeed, can be thought a higher privilege in the dispensation of love and Christian faith than this, that mortal man should acquire by grace the attribute which angels have by nature? So it is that the divine oracle promises as by a peculiar concession that the Virgins shall follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. Let us then consider what manner of man he was, who, stationed on the royal throne in the midst of worldly wealth and luxury, strove to conquer self, by treading under foot all carnal desires, as is shown by the incorruptibility of his flesh. And let those who render to him the ministry of human reverence strive to the utmost to please him by that purity of life, which his uncorrupted body proves to have been his continual happiness; and, if they cannot do so with the flower of virgin modesty, let them at least steadfastly mortify their desire for pleasure, of which they have had past experience. For should the Presence of that sacred spirit, which no eye can detect, and which is not confined by limits of space, be offended by the foul life of any of his ministers, it is to be feared that, according to the dreadful threat of the prophet, ``He hath done iniquity in the land of the saints, and therefore shall not see the glory of the Lord.'' Feeling the terror of such a doom, let us implore the protection of Saint Eadmund, king and martyr, that he may deliver us, and all those who worthily minister to him, from those sins for which we deserve to be punished, through Him who lives and reigns, world without end, Amen.

PASSION OF SAINT EDMUND, KING AND MARTYR.

A certain very learned monk came from the South, over the sea, from  Saint Benedict's Stow, in the days of king \AE{}thelred, to archbishop  Dunstan, three years before he died; and the monk was called Abbo. Then they were in  conversation till Dunstan told him about saint Edmund, even as Edmund's sword-bearer told it to king \AE{}thelstan, when  Dunstan was a young man and the sword-bearer a very old man. Then the monk put  all this story in a book, and afterwards,  when the book had come to us, within a few years, we turned it into  English just as it stands hereafter. This monk Abbo within two years went home to his minster, and  was almost immediately appointed abbot in that same minster.\linebreak{}

Then Hingwar turned eastward with his ships, \\
and Hubba was left in Northumbria, \\
having won the victory by means of cruelty. \\
Then Hingwar came rowing to East Anglia \\
in the year when \AE{}lfred the \ae{}theling was one and twenty years old, \\
he who afterward became the renowned king of the West-Saxons. \\
And the aforesaid Hingwar suddenly, like a wolf,  \\
stalked over the land and slew the people, \\
men and women, and witless children, \\
and shamefully tormented the innocent Christians. \\
Then soon afterward he sent to the king \\
a threatening message, that he must bow down \\
to do him homage, if he recked of his life. \\
So the messenger came to king Edmund, \\
and speedily announced to him Hingwar's message. \\
``Hingwar our king, keen and victorious \\
by sea and by land, hath rule over many peoples, \\
and has landed here suddenly even now with an army, \\
that he may take up his winter-quarter's here with his host. \\
Now he commandeth thee to divide thy secret treasures  \\
and thine ancestors' wealth quickly with him, \\
and thou shalt be his under-king, if thou desire to live, \\
because thou hast not the power that thou mayst withstand him.'' \\
So then king Edmund called a bishop  \\
who was handiest to him, and consulted with him \\
how he should answer the savage Hingwar. \\
Then the bishop feared for this terrible misfortune, \\
and for the king's life, and said that it seemed best to him \\
that he should submit to that which Hingwar bade him. \\
Then the king kept silence and looked on the ground, \\
and said to him at last even like a king; \\
``Behold, thou bishop, the poor people of this land \\

that I should fall in fight against him who would possess \\
my people's inheritance.'' And the bishop said, \\
``Alas, thou dear king thy people lie slain,  \\
and thou hast not sufficient forces with which thou mayest fight, \\
and these seamen will come and will bind thee alive, \\
unless thou save thy life by means of flight, \\
or thus save thyself by yielding to him.'' \\
Then said Edmund the king, full brave as he was; \\
``This I desire and wish in my mind, \\
that I should not be left alone after my dear thanes, \\
who even in their beds, with their bairns and their wives, \\
have by these seamen been suddenly slain. \\
It was never my custom to take to flight,  \\
but I would rather die, if I must, \\
for my own land; and almighty God knoweth \\
that I will never turn aside from His worship, \\
nor from His true love, whether I die or live.'' \\
After these words he turned to the messenger \\
whom Hingwar had sent to him, and said to him undismayed: \\
``Verily thou wouldest now be worthy of death, \\
but I will not defile my clean hands \\
with thy foul blood, because I follow Christ, \\
who hath so given us an example, and I will blithely \\
be slain by you, if God hath so ordained. \\
Depart now very quickly, and say to thy cruel lord; \\
Edmund the king will never bow in life to Hingwar \\
the heathen leader, unless he will first bow,  \\
in this land, to Jesus Christ with faith.'' \\
Then went the messenger quickly away, \\
and met on the way the bloodthirsty Hingwar \\
with all his army hurrying to Edmund, \\
and told that wicked man how he was answered. \\
Hingwar then arrogantly commanded his troops \\
that they should, all of them, take the king alone, \\

who had despised his command, and instantly bind him. \\
Then Edmund the king, when Hingwar came, \\
stood within his hall mindful of the Saviour, \\
and threw away his weapons, desiring to imitate \\
Christ's example, who forbade Peter \\
to fight with weapons against the bloodthirsty Jews.\footnote[\textdagger]{John xviii., \oldstylenums{11}.} \\
Then those wicked men bound Edmund, \\
and shamefully insulted him, and beat him with clubs, \\
and afterward they led the faithful king \\
to an earth-fast tree, and tied him thereto \\
with hard bonds, and afterwards scourged him \\
a long while with whips, and ever he called, \\
between the blows, with true faith, \\
on Jesus Christ; and then the heathen \\
because of his faith were madly angry, \\
because he called upon Christ to help him. \\
They shot at him with javelins as if for their amusement, \\
until he was all beset with their shots, \\
as with a porcupine's bristles, even as Sebastian was. \\
When Hingwar, the wicked seaman, \\
saw that the noble king would not deny Christ, \\
but with steadfast faith ever called upon Him, \\
then he commanded men to behead him, and the heathen did so. \\
For while he was yet calling upon Christ, \\
the heathen drew away the saint, to slay him, \\
and with one blow struck off his head; \\
and his soul departed joyfully to Christ. \\
There was a certain man at hand, kept by God \\
hidden from the heathen, who heard all this, \\
and told it afterward even as we tell it here. \\
So then the seamen went again to ship, \\
and hid the head of the holy Edmund \\
in the thick brambles, that it might not be buried. \\
Then after a space, after they were gone away, \\
came the country-folk, who were still left there, \\

and were very sore at heart because of his murder, \\
and chiefly because they had not the head with the body. \\
Then said the spectator who previously beheld it \\
that the seamen had taken the head with them, \\
and it seemed to him, even as it was quite true, \\
that they had hidden the head in the wood somewhere about. \\
Then they all went seeking at last in the wood, \\
seeking everywhere among the thorns and brambles \\
if they might anywhere find the head. \\
There was eke a great wonder, that a wolf was sent, \\
by God's direction, to guard the head \\
against the other animals by day and night. \\
They went on seeking and always crying out, \\
as is often the wont of those who go through woods; \\
``Where art thou now, comrade?'' And the head answered them, \\
``Here, here, here.'' And so it cried out continually, \\
answering them all, as oft as any of them cried,  \\
until they all came to it by means of those cries. \\
There lay the gray wolf who guarded the head, \\
and with his two feet had embraced the head, \\
greedy and hungry, and for God's care durst no \\
taste the head, but kept it against (other) animals. \\
Then they were astonished at the wolf's guardianship, \\
and carried the holy head home with them, \\
thanking the Almighty for all His wonders; \\
but the wolf followed forth with the head \\
until they came to the town, as if he were tame, \\
and then turned back again unto the wood. \\
Then the country-people afterward laid the head \\
by the holy body, and buried him \\
as they best might in such haste, \\
and full soon built a church over him. \\
Then again, after a space, after many years, \\
when the harrying had ceased, and peace was restored \\

to the oppressed people, then they came together, \\

because that frequently miracles were done at his burial-place, \\
even at the bede-house where he was buried. \\
Then desired they to carry the holy body \\
with popular honour, and to lay it within the church. \\
Then there was a great wonder, that he was all as whole \\
as if he were alive, with clean body, \\
and his neck was healed which before was cut through, \\
and there was as it were a silken thread about his neck, all red, \\
as if to show men how he was slain. \\
Also the wounds, which the bloodthirsty heathen \\
had made in his body by their repeated shots, \\
were healed by the heavenly God; \\
and so he lieth uncorrupt until this present day, \\
awaiting the resurrection and the eternal glory. \\
His body showeth us, which lieth undecayed, \\
that he lived without fornication here in this world, \\
and by a pure life passed to Christ. \\
A certain widow who was called Oswyn \\

She would every year cut the hair of the saint, \\
and cut his nails soberly and lovingly, \\

Then once upon a time came some unblessed thieves, \\
eight in one night, to the venerable saint, \\
desiring to steal the treasures which people had brought thither, \\

one of them filed about it with a file; \\
one dug under the door with a spade; \\

Then men wondered to see how the wretches hung there, \\

Gregory by name, said in his writing \\
concerning the holy Lawrence who lieth in the city of Rome, \\
that men were always wishing to see how he lay, \\
both good and evil, but God checked them, \\
so that there died in the looking all at once \\
seven men together; so the others desisted \\
from looking at the martyr with human error. \\
We have heard of many wonders in the popular talk \\
about the holy Edmund which we will not here \\
set down in writing; but every one knoweth them. \\
By this saint is it manifest and by others like him, \\
that Almighty God can raise man \\
again, in the day of judgement, incorruptible from the earth, \\
He who preserveth Edmund whole in his body \\
until the great day, though he was made of earth. \\
Worthy is the place for the sake of the venerable saint \\
that men should venerate it, and well provide it \\
with God's pure servants, to Christ's service, \\
because the saint is greater than men may imagine. \\
The English nation is not deprived of the Lord's saints, \\
since in English land lie such saints \\
as this holy king, and the blessed Cuthbert, \\
and saint \AE{}thelthryth in Ely, and also her sister, \\
incorrupt in body, for the confirmation of the faith. \\
There are also many other saints among the English, \\
who work many miracles, as is widely known, \\
to the praise of the Almighty in whom they believed. \\
Christ showeth to men, through His illustrious saints, \\
that He is Almighty God who causeth such wonders, \\
though the miserable Jews altogether denied Him, \\
because they are accursed, as they desired for themselves. \\
There are no wonders wrought at their sepulchres, \\
because they believe not in the living Christ; \\
but Christ manifesteth to men where the true faith is, \\
since He worketh such miracles by His saints \\
